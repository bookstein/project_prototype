Subject: re : 8 . 810 , sum : french loan words , language evolution

just saw your summary on french loanwords in english . i think baugh took the 10 , 000 word figure from jespersen 's _ growth and structure of the english language _ . it would be more like jespersen than baugh to actually try to count them , in fact . it 's worth looking at jespersen for all sorts of facts like these , in his chapter on the french influence in that book . - - suzanne kemmer
