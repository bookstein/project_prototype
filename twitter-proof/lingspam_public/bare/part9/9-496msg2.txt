( 2 ) there will be around twenty slots for presentations of selected papers . each selected paper will be allotted 25 minutes , including discussion . there will only be plenary sessions . - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - lot landelijke onderzoekschool taalwetenschap netherlands graduate school of linguistics trans 10 3512 jk utrecht phone : + 31 30 2536006 fax : + 31 30 2536000 - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
