kluwer academic publishers is proud to announce the publication of : the informational complexity of learning : perspectives on neural networks and generative grammar by partha niyogi massachusetts institute of technology among other topics , the informational complexity of learning : perspectives on neural networks and generative grammar brings together two important but very different learning problems within the same analytical framework . the first concerns the problem of learning functional mappings using neural networks , followed by learning natural language grammars in the principles and parameters tradition of chomsky . these two learning problems are seemingly very different . neural networks are real-valued , infinite-dimensional , continuous mappings . on the other hand , grammars are boolean-valued , finite-dimensional , discrete ( symbolic ) mappings . the book 's objective is to bridge this gap . it uses the formal techniques developed in statistical learning theory and theoretical computer science over the last decade to analyze both kinds of learning problems . specific results include model selection in neural networks , active learning , language learning and evolutionary models of language change . the informational complexity of learning : perspectives on neural networks and generative grammar is a very interdisciplinary work . all individuals interested in the interaction of computer science and cognitive science should enjoy the book . researchers in artificial intelligence , neural networks , linguistics , theoretical computer science , and statistics will find it particularly relevant . contents foreword . preface . 1 . introduction . 2 . generalization error for neural nets . 3 . active learning . 4 . language learning . 5 . language change . 6 . conclusions . 1998 248 pp . isbn 0-7923 - 8081 - 9 $ 98 . 00 for more information about this publication , please visit our on - line catalogue at : http : / / www . wkap . nl or you may order directly from : kluwer academic publishers 101 philip drive norwell , ma . 02061 phone : 781-871 - 6600 , fax : ( 781 ) 871-6528 , e - mail : kluwer @ wkap . com kluwer academic publishers p . o . box 322 3300 ah dordrecht , the netherlands phone 31 78 639 2392 , fax : 31 78 6546474 , e - mail : services @ wkap . nl
