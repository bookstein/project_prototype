new from holland academic graphics : syntactic and lexical deverbal morphology in dutch by frans van der putten abstract : _ matter and mind in morphology _ investigates the nature and place of morphology . the underlying assumption is that morphology can be both lexical and syntactic , and that the distinctive properties of the two types of morphology follow from the nature of the lexicon and the syntax respectively . the human language system is argued to consist of a matter - domain and a mind - domain . the matter - domain comprises the syntax as well as the lf and pf modules . its properties ( governing principles , vocabulary , type of categorization ) are those commonly assumed in generative linguistics , and operations taking place in this domain are unconscious and fast . the mind - domain , on the other hand , is a conceptual module where language utterances are matched with a speaker 's knowledge of the world . it makes use of semantic notions ( thematic roles , features like [ + / - human ] or [ + / - animate ] and aspectual notions ) and prototype categorization . processes in this domain are slower and semi-conscious . the lexicon is the interface between the two domains , its main function being the translation of information from one domain into the format of the other . this language model is the basis on which distinctive properties of syntactic and lexical morphology are formulated . in the remaining part of the dissertation , these distinctive properties are used to identify a variety of morphological processes in dutch as either 's yntactic ' , ' lexical ' or ' mixed ' . since the distinction between lexical and syntactic morphology is primarily relevant in the case of word formation based on verbs , the discussion focuses on deverbal processes deriving nouns , adjectives and verbs . the book is aimed at linguists interested in the place and nature of morphology in general and at those investigating dutch deverbal morphology . paperback , xiii + 379 pp .
