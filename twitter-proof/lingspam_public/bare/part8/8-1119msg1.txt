Subject: anglicization of composers ' names

judging from the return post , i must have sounded like some kind of self-proclaimed expert on composers ' names . let me hasten to say that i ' m not . all the pronunciations i put in that little list came as surprises to me . in all cases but one , they were given to me by native speakers of the composers ' language , while i was visiting the composers ' native country . i do n't speak any of those languages and certainly do not claim any expertise . i ' ve just been trusting " competent native speakers " . the one exception , by the way , was when karl haas , on one of his daily " adventures in good music " broadcasts , asserted that pachelbel should be pronounced pach - el - bel . based on karl 's provenance i was inclined to trust him . but perhaps i ' ve gone overboard taking natives ' pronunciations as gospel . after all , we americans certainly manage to mangle enough of our own words , do n't we ? sorry for any consternation i may have caused . i ' ve certainly gotten an education from this . cheers , gordon brown
