Subject: on line versions of newspapers

dear readers of the linguist list , as we are planning a research project which is going to address itself to the phenomenon of on line versions of newspapers and magazines ( from a linguistic , semiotic and media-studies point of view , but also from a psychological and information-technological perspective ) , we would like to know whether there are any colleagues out there who deal with a similar subject . we are in the know about some people and some projects , but we suspect there must be more people who share an interest in this highly topical issue , however do n't know of one another 's existence and engagement in the matter . we would be only too pleased to make contact with those people , i . e . with . . . you ! prof . dr . martin stegu chair of applied linguistics technical university of chemnitz d-09107 chemnitz germany e-mail : martin . stegu @ phil . tu-chemnitz . de
