Subject: summary : vowel deletion between two like consonants

quite some time ago , i wrote requesting information concerning instances of proper names where the pronunciation reflects a deletion of a vowel occuring between two like consonants in the spelling of the name . i cited such names as farrer [ fer ] worcester [ wust ^ r ] and leicester [ lest ^ r ] and had hoped to find a whole slew of other names exhibiting this phenomenon . unfortunately , i got no responses which dealt with proper nouns . however , i did get some interesting responses discussing how this occurs in hungarian , arabic , and english outside the realm of proper nouns . thanks to all who responded . sorry i did n't post sooner . it 's just that i had hoped to get something on proper nouns before replying . sincerely , david harris david harris david @ las-inc . com language analysis systems voice : ( 703 ) 834-6200 ext . 242 2214 rock hill road , suite 201 fax : ( 703 ) 834-6230 herndon , va 22070 original query : > i ' ve been thinking about names like worcester , leicester , and > gloucester which , though perhaps viewed by most of my fellow americans > as strange relics of british eccentricity , really do follow a simple > and straightforward phonological process where two like consonantal > continuants separated by a weak vowel ( in this case schwa ) are merged > into one by the deletion of this weak vowel . the same phenomenon > occurs with the name of a school in provo , utah which i attended as an > adolescent : > > farrer junior high school > this is pronounced " fair " ( or " ferr " if your accent makes a > difference between [ er ] and [ eir ] which mine does n't ) > > anyway , using a regular expression , i searched the 1990 us census > list of 80 , 000 surnames available on the web in order to find names > in which like consonants were separated by one vowel and came across > a few more from various language groups that may or may not be > examples of this .
