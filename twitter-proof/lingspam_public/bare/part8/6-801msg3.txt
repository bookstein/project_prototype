Subject: odd descriptions of character

in discussing some old , and some contemporary , character descriptions given to people , i was wondering about some of their derivations . for instance , does anyone know of the origin and / or historical meaning of some of the following strange and humorous appellations ? nincompoop knucklehead blockhead nerd dweeb geek i expect some of the terms to have been fanciful phonological inventions ( such as in lewis carroll 's _ alice in wonderland _ ) , but others might actually be derived from meaningful ( even if pejorative ) references . if you have any input , i 'd like to hear it . thanks , michael beard wayne state university 73131 . 3101 @ compuserve . com
