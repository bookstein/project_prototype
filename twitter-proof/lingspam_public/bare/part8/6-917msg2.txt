Subject: query : vp ellipsis and v - raising

i am looking at vp ellipsis in overt v - raising languages . in particular , i need to find out whether the equivalent of ( 1 ) , with the vp being deleted after the verb moves out of it , is acceptable in overt v - raising languages . for control , i need to check whether vp ellipsis is possible in constructions such as ( 2 ) , which presumably would not necessarily involve main verb raising in the relevant languages . ( 1 ) john put the book on the table and peter put too . ( 2 ) a . john has put the book on the table and peter has too . b . john must put the book on the table and peter must too . if you know of any relevant facts and / or references , please respond directly to me . i will post a summary if there is sufficient interest . zeljko boskovic boskovic @ uconnvm . uconn . edu department of linguistics , u-145 university of connecticut storrs , ct 06269
