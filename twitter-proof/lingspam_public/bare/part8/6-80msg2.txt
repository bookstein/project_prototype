Subject: latex and macintosh

you ' ve already made up your mind , it seems , but i want to point out that there are four implementations of tex and latex for the macintosh , three shareware and one commercial . besides the very weak ( in my not particularly humble opinion ) wsuipa fonts , latex allows the use of adobe type 1 and type 3 ( " postscript " ) fonts , so that you can use the sil ipa fonts , or those available commercially from adobe ( times roman , stone sans serif and stone serif ) or ecological linguistics ( cf . the recent message from lloyd anderson ) . this is true whichever platform you decide to use . rich alderson
