Subject: new book : van de vijver : the iambic issue .

ruben van de vijver , the iambic issue . iambs as a result of constraint interaction in iambic languages stress on both the first and on the last syllable is avoided ; iambs are not assigned from right to left ; the prototypical iambic foot does not play a role in prosodic morphology . building on optimality theory , van de vijver argues that iambic feet are the result of constraint interaction rather than being building blocks of metrical theory . van de vijver presents detailed analyses of the stress patterns of several carib and yupik languages and shows that the rightheaded feet found on the surface in these languages are the result of the interaction between a constraint which favors leftheaded feet and a constraint which bars both the initial and the final syllable from being stressed . he argues further that iambs can only arise at the left edge of the word and analyzes the stress patterns of several lan - guages which are claimed to have iambs arising at the right edge of the word . one of the conclusions is that the prototypical iamb is never used as a building block in prosodic morphology . contents : 1 . introduction 2 . stress in cariban languages 3 . yupik prosody 4 . only the trochee : stress from right to left 5 . feet in prosodic morphology 6 . summary and conclusions 1998 . 271pp . isbn 90-5569 - 040 - 6 . paperback .
