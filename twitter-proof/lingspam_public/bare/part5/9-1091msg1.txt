Subject: new book from mitwpl : phonology - syntax interface

new book in phonology available from mit working papers in linguistics in 1998 : truckenbrodt , hubert ( 1995 ) . phonological phrases : their relation to syntax , focus , and prominence . mit dissertation . 194 pages . $ 12 . abstract this thesis investigates what forces relate phonological phrases to the syntactic representation , to focus , and to the representation of prominence . the proposal that is defended is that there is a triangle of syntactic constituency , prosodic constituency , and phrasal prominence , in which the grammar places a simple demand on each pair in the triangle : ( a ) syntactic phrases must be contained in phonological phrases . ( b ) phonological phrases must have edgemost phrasal prominence . ( c ) syntactic phrases must contain phrasal prominence . these demands are taken to interact with one another as ranked and violable constraints , where variation among languages is expressed in terms of constraint reranking . each relation is argued for independently . the effects of ( a ) ( previously analyzed as the role of government in phonological phrasing ) will be investigated on patterns of phrasing in the bantu languages chi mwi : ni , chichewa , and kimatuumbi . the effects of ( b ) , it is argued , can be seen most clearly in the effects of focus on phrasing , where chichewa and japanese will be discussed as examples . the effects of ( c ) , finally , which have been discussed in different contexts as either a directionality parameter of the role of depth of embedding in the assignment of stress , will be argued to have desirable typological consequences that set ( c ) apart from some of its competitors . jointly , the constraints will be seen to derive an end-based typology of the kind familiar from work by lisa selkirk . ordering information : http : / / broca . mit . edu / mitwpl . web / wpls . html
