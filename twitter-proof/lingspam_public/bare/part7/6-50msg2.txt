Subject: re : 6 . 39 have ) of

it seems to me that the use of have + simple past is rapidly increasing in the u . s . it 's showing up now in newspapers and on television , and , perhaps most tellingly , in the speech of acquaintances who i am sure did not have it a few years ago . my first thought was that this had something to do with the have ) of reanalysis , but i have now heard too many instances of emphatic " have " to believe this . examples such as " even if he had went earlier , . . . " abound . i find these examples easy to spot because i still wince whenever i hear one .
