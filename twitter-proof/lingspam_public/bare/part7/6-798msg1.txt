Subject: neurophysiology and written language

i would be grateful for references to recent research that would fall under the category of neurophysiology . does anyone know of studies on aphasic or other kinds of patients who are trying to recover fluency in the use of language by using computers to communicate with therapists , caretakers , or doctors ? the focus of this type of research should be on the strengthening of neural networks through the use of computers by sending and receiving messages . it could also involve performing specific types of exercises that stress writing as opposed to speech . your assistance will be greatly appreciated . please reply to sotillo @ apollo . montclair . edu
