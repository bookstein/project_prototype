Subject: english parser

logos corporation has a pretty good english semantico-syntactic parser ( tagger as a minimum ) incorporated in a machine translation product . we are going to package this as an independent unix - based software package for the institut fuer deutsche sprache in mannheim , germany , and quite possibily a copy of this might be made available to other researchers . this should be readysometime in the next monthor two , as i understand it . the parser dictionary has c . 40 , 000 entries . if interested , please send me a description of intended use , input format considerations , etc . and i ' ll pass it by the powers that be . if your usage would include parser ( tagger ) evaluation , error rates , error feedback , etc . , so much the better . bud scott
