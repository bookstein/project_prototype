Subject: c - insertion

can anyone guide me to material documenting insertion of consonsants to break up impermissible vowel clusters , in which the choice of consonant is not conditioned by the nature of its surrounding vowels ? i ' m thinking , for example , of glides between non-high vowels , or relicts of consonants that were once there historically , but are no longer considered underlyingly present in the basic form of the word . thanks for any help . james kirchner
