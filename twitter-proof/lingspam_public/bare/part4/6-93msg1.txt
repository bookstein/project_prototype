but there are no real outlets for the plain presentation and discussion of * data * . this meeting will consist of two elements : a . a collection of data , printed as an issue in the society 's occasional series , _ the yuen ren society treasury of chinese dialect data _ , and b . a presentation of the data by the fieldworker or compiler , together with discussion by the audience . the _ treasury _ will be available at the meeting , where it will serve as the handout . ii . deadlines . 28 january 1995 , for submission of an abstract and either a full-length draft of the material or a reasonably long sample from it . 28 february 1995 , for receipt by the society of the final camera-ready draft . this deadline is firm ; if you are afraid you are going to miss it , you should be in touch with the society * before * that happens . there is no deadline for registration at the conference , but we would like to know beforehand if you plan to attend . iii . submission of material . anyone wishing to present data at the society 's conference must submit it for publication in the _ yuen ren treasury of chinese dialect data _ . all submissions will be subject to review . if you cannot be present at the conference , you may still submit material to the current issue of the _ treasury _ . this conference is independent of the american oriental society meeting . there is no fee for the yuen ren society meeting , but it is the responsibility of everyone who attends to pay any aos registration fees that may be required of them . iv . attendance by non-participants . the conference is open to everyone , including people who are not members of the yuen ren society . there will be no fee for attending the conference , but there may be a small on-site registration fee for anyone who wants a copy of the _ yuen ren treasury _ . the _ treasury _ will serve as the combined handout for the whole conference . v . notes on style and format . 1 . the society favors the use of gwoyeu romatzyh , but will not reject any other reasonable system of romanization , as long as all tonal distinctions are represented in some consistent way . papers that use romanization without some form of tonal distinction will be rejected . both traditional and simplified characters are welcome . 2 . the languages of the conference and of all papers should be english or mandarin . 3 . length of individual presentations at the conference will be variable , with up to 25 minutes per presentation , and discussion ad hoc . please tell the society how long your presentation will be . length of documents in the _ treasury _ will also be variable , depending on their contents . 4 . all papers should include a section in the bibliography entitled " sources of dialect data " or something comparable , in addition to the ordinary list of works cited . papers introducing data from original fieldwork * must * list the names of all sites represented , together with information about the informants used and the dates of fieldwork . papers using any data not gathered by the author personally * must * list the sources of each distinct set of data . it is a good idea to distinguish different sources , even if they represent the same site . 5 . all submissions to the _ yuen ren treasury _ must be made in camera-ready hard copy . handwritten documents , unless they are remarkably neat , will ordinarily be rejected . for documents produced on a computer , common serif fonts such as courier or new york should be used for roman letter writing apart from ipa , and a sharply legible bitmap or outline font such as sung should be used for kanji . very neatly handwritten kanji are acceptable . if in doubt , send a sample of your typefaces to the society * before * the submission deadline . 6 . finished documents should have margins a minimum of one inch wide . print should be black only , and the body of the text should be between 12 and 14 point in size and double spaced . documents produced on a computer should be printed at not less than 300 dpi . 7 . in general , papers should follow the style guidelines of a recent edition of the _ chicago manual of style _ . vi . restrictions : barring exceptional circumstances , the following will be considered outside the scope of the conference , since there are already other outlets for them : 1 . papers emphasizing formal analysis or formal representation . 2 . new romanization schemes . 3 . papers comparing a single modern dialect to the jin ' in ( a . k . a . _ chiehyunn _ ) phonological system . 4 . papers all of whose data is culled from published sources , unless the source is rare or for some reason poorly known . 5 . studies of " mandarin " , " taiwanese " , " cantonese " , " hakka " , or other standard dialects , based neither on fieldwork nor the speech of named sites or sources . 6 . presentations that do not consist primarily of data .
