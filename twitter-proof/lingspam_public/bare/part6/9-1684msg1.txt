from holland academic graphics dynamic excursions on weak islands by martin honcoop dynamic excursions on weak island investigates the phenomenon of weak islands within the framework of dynamic semantics . weak islands are contexts that are transparent with respect to some , though not all quantificational dependencies that involve an operator and a variable-expression . specifically , this book explores the consequences of the novel claim that weak islands reduce to the same principles of dynamic semantics that account for inaccessibility . in addition , it examines in both empirical and theoretical terms the precise relationship between the dynamic theory of weak islands and the algebraic semantic approach developed by szabolcsi & zwarts ( 1993 ) . this inquiry leads to a number of further developments of dynamic semantics , such as an intensional version of existential disclosure and an algorithm for computing the dynamic properties of an expression on the basis of its boolean properties . contents : 1 . preamble : a semantic account of weak islands 2 . a dynamic semantics 3 . dynamic binding across weak islands algaebraic versus dynamic perspectives on weak islands 5 . summary and conclusions 1998 . xx + 218 pp . isbn : 90 5569 056 2 . paperback .
