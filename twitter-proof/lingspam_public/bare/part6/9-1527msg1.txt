- substantial papers with new results , b ) research notes ( short papers ) - - work-in - progress or very specific results , and c ) position papers ( letters ) . major reports in application and tool categories should be based on running implementations . demonstrations of running implementations during the conference will be encouraged . research notes may be based on partial implementations or designs . position papers allows individuals to report on current activities and conjectures within the area defined by the call for papers without the need for presenting results . all submitted papers must be in english . major reports are limited to 14 standard size pages in length , single spaced , including title , author names and affiliations , abstract , figures and references . research notes are limited to 7 pages with the same constraints . position papers are limited to 1 page . authors have to specify the category ( s ) and the type of their submitted paper . according to the referee reports , changes of category or type may be required . all accepted papers are published in the same proceedings . registration of one of the authors will be required with the final version of an accepted paper . submitted papers must be received on or before january 1st , 1999 . a separate presentation page is requested earlier ( december 23 , 1998 ) . the presentation page should contain the following information : the title , category ( theory and analysis , applications , or tools ) and type ( major report or research notes or position paper ) of the paper , the names , affiliation and e-mail addresses of all authors , the postal address of one author chosen as the corresponding author , one or two keywords chosen in the topics of interest list , possibly additional phrases describing the content if the available keywords do not fit well , and an abstract . a form for the presentation page will be provided on iccs ' 99 web site in due time . authors may also send the presentation page in plain text format through electronic mail , to iccs99 @ monmouth . edu . papers are submitted electronically , using postscript format . please make sure that your paper is entirely printable from the postscript file . if you encounter any problem , please contact the program chair ( btepfenh @ moncol . monmouth . edu ) . special sessions in addition to the main conference , there will be a special session on the sisyphus / conceptual graphs initiative i . papers are to be submitted separately . questions concerning this special track are to be referred to prof . guy mineau at mineau @ ift . ulaval . ca or dr . dickson luckose at lukose @ brightware . com . -
