Subject: simultaneous prepositions and postpositions in pashto

i ' m looking for analyses of nominal constructions ( in any language ) in which the np has _ both _ a preposition and a postposition . for example , pashto has constructions like the following , from herbert penzl , _ a grammar of pashto _ ( washington , d . c . : american council of learned societies , 1955 ) , p . 41 : we sarri te to man to ' to the man ' the preposition is sometimes optional , though the postposition is obligatory . since pashto is head-final ( the unmarked word order is sov ) , it 's tempting to take the postposition at face-value . however , there are some binding facts that suggest that a phrase containing an np + postposition is referential , and so it might be possible to analyze the postposition as some kind of case marker . i understand that there may be such a distinction between homophonous case markers and postpositions in japanese , for example . i 'd be grateful if anyone could suggest any articles that deal with these constructions . and if there are other linguists who are studying pashto , i 'd like to hear from you . thanks for any help ! taylor roberts < troberts @ mit . edu >
