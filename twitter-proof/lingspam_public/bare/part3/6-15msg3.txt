as well as the possible contributions of the analysis of time , space and movement in language to the comprehension of the organization of the perceived objects , and to the identification of their cognitively relevant properties . contributions are invited on substantial and original research on various aspects of time , space and movement , including , but not limited to , the following . a . semantics of time , space and movement in natural language - lexical semantics : from linguistic and conceptual description to formalisation - from lexicon to sentence and discourse : role of the spatial and spatio-temporal ( s & st ) common-sense knowledge in discourse interpretation - logics and deductive mechanisms : * for the computation of the s & st reference * for the cognitive validation of discourse representations b . knowledge representation and s & st reasoning - ontology of s & st entities : philosophical analysis and formalisation - mental representations of space , time and movement - mathematics of the sensible world - naive physics , qualitative s & st reasoning - logics and visual reasoning - contributions to discourse representation c . relations between language and perception - imaginal and / or propositional structures of mental representations - from language to visual perception : from propositional to numerical structures ( image synthesis ) - from visual perception to language : from numerical to propositional structures ( image interpretation ) - mathematical and logical problems of hybrid reasoning invited speakers ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ nicholas asher , linguistics and philosophy , austin patrick blackburn , logic and computational linguistics , saarbruecken mimo caenepeel * , linguistics , edinburgh anthony cohn , artificial intelligence , leeds john etchemendy , philosophy , stanford luis farinas del cerro , logics and computer science , toulouse christian freksa * , cognitive science , hamburg christopher habel * , cognitive science , hamburg patrick hayes * , artificial intelligence , urbana gerd herzog , artificial intelligence , saarbruecken hans kamp * , linguistics and philosophy , stuttgart manfred krifka , linguistics , austin carlota smith , linguistics , austin barbara tversky * , psychology , stanford claude vandeloise , linguistics , baton - rouge achille varzi , philosophy , trento henk verkuyl , linguistics , utrecht co vet , linguistics , groningen ( * ) to be confirmed programme committee ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ chair : mario borillo , artificial intelligence , toulouse nicholas asher , linguistics and philosophy , austin patrick blackburn , logics and computational linguistics , saarbruecken andree borillo , linguistics , toulouse anthony cohn , artificial intelligence , leeds john etchemendy , philosophy , stanford patrick hayes , artificial intelligence , urbana carlota smith , linguistics , austin barbara tversky , psychology , stanford achille varzi , philosophy , trento co vet , linguistics , groningen laure vieu , artificial intelligence , toulouse format for submission ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ submitted papers should be at most 12 pages in length and be produced in 12pt ( default latex article style is ok ) . submissions should provide the affiliation , full postal address , telephone and fax numbers , and e-mail address ( if any ) of the author ( s ) . a few words stating the position of the paper with respect to the topics of interest would be useful , as well as a 100-200 word abstract . electronic submission ( plain ascii , latex , uuencoded postscript , or binhex mac word files ) is recommended . they should be sent to tsm @ irit . fr before 10 february 1995 . hard - copy submissions ( 4 copies ) should reach the programme chair no late than 10 february 1995 . notification of acceptance will be sent to authors by 10 april , 1995 , and final versions ( camera-ready ) will be due by 15 may , 1995 . these will be compiled as workshop notes to be distributed to the participants . schedule ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ papers submission . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 10 february , 1995 notification of acceptance . . . . . . 10 april , 1995 final version due . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 15 may , 1995 workshop . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 23-27 june , 1995 organization ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ organizing committee : pascal amsili , irit michel aurnague , erss andree borillo , erss mario borillo , irit myriam bras - grivart , irit pierre sablayrolles , irit laure vieu , irit contact : tsm ' 95 c / o mario borillo irit - universite paul sabatier 118 , route de narbonne , f-31062 toulouse cedex france tel : ( + 33 ) 61 . 55 . 60 . 91 fax : ( + 33 ) 61 . 55 . 83 . 25 e - mail : tsm @ irit . fr www : http : / / www . irit . fr / activites / eq _ lrc / tsm95 . html
