Subject: foreign language in commercials

content - length : 1937 greetings ! i ' m wondering if someone out there can identify the languages used in two recent ibm commercials . they have out a series of three ads with people in different countries talking about ibm equipment and services . one ad has two old gentlemen walking along what looks like the seine , speaking french . a second ad has two men sitting in what is apparently a middle eastern marketplace , and a third ad has nuns discussing ibm equipment on their way to mass . i assume the men are speaking arabic ( though i would be grateful to have that confirmed ) , but i have no idea what the nuns are speaking . anyone know ? i would also like to take this opportunity to thank all those who responded to my questions early last year about some french , italian and swedish expressions in some print ads . i meant to send individual thanks , but i lost the file in which i had the respondents ! please forgive me , and accept this general acknowledgment instead . if any of you who did respond would like to know more about what we did with your input , i would be glad to send you more information ( even the paper we wrote , if you want ) . thanks very much , mary ellen renryder @ idbsu . idbsu . edu
