Subject: tolkienian linguistics

i know that the subject of tolkienian linguistics is not exactly at the forefront of modern linguisitic research , but i also know that many modern linguists were inspired , in whole or in part , by the life and linguistic creations of j . r . r . tolkien , whose centenary is being celebrated this year . so , in that spirit , i would like to let everyone here know about " vinyar tengwar " ( issn 1054-7606 ) , a bimonthly journal devoted to formal study of tolkien 's linguistic work , with primary focus on his invented languages , especially quenya and sindarin ( noldorin ) .
