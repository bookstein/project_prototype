Subject: translators needed for women for women !

i am posting the following message for my friends who are not on the list : * would you like to use your language skills to help women survivors of the war in bosnia and croatia ? women for women , a u . s . based , nonprofit sponsorship program sending letters and money each month to the region , is desperately seeking volunteer translators . we translate letters both from and to english . even if you can manage only a handful of letters each month , it would lighten the load for the few translators we have now . for more information , call our office at ( 703 ) 519-1730 , and leave a message for zainab or robin . thank you ! * you may also send an e-mail message to me mima @ seur . voa . gov and i will forward it to * women for women : .
