Subject: chomsky citations

forgive me if i missed this , but in the earlier discussion of chomsky 's elevated position in the citations index , did anyone work out how many of the citations were for his linguistic works and how many were for his political works . i ask this out of general interest , and also because a colleague of mine is interested to know the extent of his stature in academic political studies . comments on the latter could be directed directly to me .
