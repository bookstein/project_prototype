Subject: list of english taboo words

does anyone have a reasonably large list of english taboo words , preferably in machine-readable form ? i am interested in the classic " four-letter words " and their thematic relatives , as well as any other words that " should n't be used in polite company " , such as ethnic or religious slurs . slang per se is not of interest . mark a . mandel dragon systems , inc . : speech recognition : + 1 617 965-5200 320 nevada st . : newton , mass . 02160 , usa
