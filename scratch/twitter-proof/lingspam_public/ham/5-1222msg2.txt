Subject: " rain " = " falling " + " water " ?

i am trying to collect typological evidence to support etymology for turkic jagmur " rain " analysing it as jag - " to fall " + * - mur " water " , the second element being attested in manchu - tungus , korean , japanese , and possibly in mongolic . does anyone know similar examples outside of altaic ? sasha vovin avvovin @ miamiu . acs . muohio . edu
