Subject: query about english interrogatives

i would appreciate any references that discuss the relationship or correspondence between the syntactic form and the pragmatic ( or social ) function of interrogatives in english . much of the work that i am familiar with claims that any form can be used for any function . my own research suggests otherwise . please send replies directly to : freed @ apollo . montclair . edu ( alice f . freed linguistics montclair state college )
