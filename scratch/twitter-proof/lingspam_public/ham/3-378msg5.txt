hi , help ! i have to design an experiment to do with mandarin tones as part of a phonology requirement on my graduate course . there seems to be very little literature on this in the library . if anyone can think of any on-going debates on the phonology / phonetics of mandarin tones for which an experiment would be useful , please could you give me information and references . i would welcome any suggestions at all . thanks a lot , sophia wang .
