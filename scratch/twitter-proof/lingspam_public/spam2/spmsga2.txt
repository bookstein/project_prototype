Subject: $ 7 money maker and e - mail service

please follow the instructions of this letter very carefully . immediately print it and read twice . greetings hopefully my name is still on the list below . i am a retired attorney , and about two years ago a man came to me with a letter . the letter he brought me is the same as the letter in front of you now . he asked me to verify the fact that this letter was legal . i told him that i would review it and get back to him . when i first read the letter i thought it was some off-the - wall idea to make money . a week later i met again with my client to discuss the issue . i told him that the letter originally brought to me was not 100 % legal . my client asked me to alter the letter to make it 100 % legal . i advised him to make a small change in the letter and it would be all right . i was curious about the letter , so he told me how it works . i thought it was a long shot , so i decided against participating . before my client left , i asked him to keep me updated as to his results . about two months later he called to tell me that he had received over $ 800 , 000 in cash ! ! ! i didn t believe him , so he asked me to try the plan and see for myself . i thought about it for a few days and decided that there was not much to lose . i followed his instructions exactly and mailed out 200 letters . sure enough the money started coming in ! it came slowly at first , but after three weeks i was getting more than i could open in a day . after about three months the money stopped coming . i kept a precise record of my earnings and at the end it totaled $ 868 , 439 . 00 . i was earning a good living as a lawyer , but as anyone in the legal profession will tell you , there is a lot of stress that comes with the job . i told myself if things worked out i would retire from practice and play golf . i decided to try the letter again , but this time i sent out 500 letters . well , three months after that i had totaled $ 2 , 344 , 178 . 00 ! i just couldn t believe it . i met my old client for lunch to find out how this works . he told me that there were a few similar letters going around . what made this one different is the fact that there are seven names on the letter , not five like most others . that fact alone resulted in more returns . the other factor was the advice i gave him in making sure the whole thing was perfectly legal , since no one wants to risk doing anything illegal . i bet now you are curious about what little changes i told him to make . well , if you send a letter like this out , to be legal , you must sell something if you expect to receive a dollar . i told him that anyone sending a dollar out must receive something in return . so , when you send a dollar to each of the seven names on the list , you must include a slip of paper saying please put me on your mailing list and include your name , mailing address and e-mail address ( your phone # is optional ) . this is the key to the program ! the item you will receive for your dollar you send to the seven names below , is this letter and the right to earn thousands . we will be working together to improve each other s lives ! follow the simple instructions below exactly , and in less than three months you will receive over $ 800 , 000 . 00 guaranteed !
