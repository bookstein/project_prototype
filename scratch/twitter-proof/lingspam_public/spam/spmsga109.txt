Subject: . . . . . use hypnosis to make money !

hi . my name is dennis . i am a third-generation , professional hypnotherapist with over 22 years experience . i also , like many of you , spend a bit of time online . like you , i get hit by all sorts of mail either promoting sex sites or promising untold riches . being practical , i know multilevel marketing makes a lot of money for some people . . . the ones at the front end , at the beginning . but all the ones i have seen advertised are either the same one or clones of each other . i am sure you know the one i am talking about . i know people are still making money with it , or there would n't be so many advertisements . but they are n't making much , for two main reasons i can see . first it is the same , tired program that was old when i first went online a couple of years ago . anyone starting now would be at the tail end rather than the head . second perhaps more importantly . . . that program doesn ' t sell anything that people really want ! they wrote up some reports full of information that you probably either already know or do n't care about , just so they would have a product to sell . i have a solution . offer a product that people want to buy ! i have written clear , easy-to - read reports on self-hypnosis . most people have things they want to improve about their lives . many of these things , including stress , weight control , and smoking , can be taken care of with hypnosis . but people have good reasons why they do n't go to a hypnotherapist to take care of them . one is cost . even though being healthy saves money in the long run , people look at the short term expense and decide against it . another is pride . who wants to admit that they needed help from someone else ? it is almost like going to a psychiatrist . even though it is nothing to be ashamed of , it is still something few people want to admit . now people can learn how to take care of many of their problems themselves ! not only will they save money , they will have a sense of pride in being able to do it themselves . i am sure you have heard someone say before , " i lost 15 pounds " or " i quit smoking . " they are proud of what they have accomplished . i keep saying " they " because even though you will be able to use this knowledge for yourself , you will make your money by selling the reports to the many people that are also interested in hypnosis . with that other program i mentioned people have made a lot of money selling something nobody really wants . think how well you could do selling a product that is actually worth it ! i am trying to keep this email short , but want you to think about something else . i have seen multilevel emails that had the following : 1st level - 10 members with $ 5 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ $ 50 2nd level - 10 from each of those 10 ( $ 5x100 ) _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ $ 500 3rd level - 10 from each of those 100 ( $ 5x1 , 000 ) _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ $ 5 , 000 4th level - 10 from each of those 1 , 000 ( $ 5x10 , 000 ) _ _ _ _ _ $ 50 , 000 total $ 55 , 550 if they expect that much participation in a program that old , could n't you expect twice the participation per level ? getting 20 people instead of 10 for each level would make you $ 842 , 100 ! the first three reports teach how you can hypnotize yourself to improve you life . the fourth shows how to set up your email , how to get it out to others , and other tips and strategies you can use to be a success . i want you to be a success , because each person who replies to you , asking for report 1 , will also be replying to me asking for report 2 . then , when those people contact customers , you will be receiving money and orders from people you did n't even have to contact ! they will be advertising for you ! i am now going to list the reports and the addresses to order them from . just think , your name is going to be at the # 1 position , the one that makes the most money , when you send out your emails . report 1 : general information on self - hypnosis & relaxation and stress relief the perfect combination po box 798 chepachet , ri 02814 - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - report 2 : weight loss rvp po box 190 wahiawa , hi 96786 - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - report 3 : quitting smoking & other uses and tips for self - hypnosis s . franco po box 623 bonsall , ca 92003-0623 - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - report 4 : turning it into a business j . destefano box 20793 1303 e . university blvd . tucson , az 85719-0521 - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - ordering instructions : * order each report from the person whose address is under the report title . you will need all 4 reports , because you will receive orders ( and money ) for each one , as your name travels down each of the 4 levels . * each report costs $ 5 . 00 cash . imagine receiving 100s of $ 5 . 00 checks a day , wondering which ones have cleared , and which ones have n't . you can see why cash is a necessity . the money should be wrapped in 2 pieces of paper , concealing it to prevent theft . * on one sheet of paper you should include the name & number of the report you are ordering , your email address , and your postal address . please write clearly . if your email address have parts that can be confused , i . e . 0 vs . o , l vs . i , etc . , please specify which it is . * the report will be sent to you as quickly as possible after your order is received . it will be sent as an attached document via email , unless there is trouble with your email address . the postal address will then be used as a backup . * make sure you save each report as you receive it , so you will be ready to send it out as you start receiving your orders ! * as i mentioned earlier , instructions on how to set up the email for you to mail out are on report 4 . for now , it would be best if you saved this email , so you will have it to work with later . finally , i want to remind you that this is a legitimate business . you should treat it as such when you enter it . you can talk to the small business administration if you need help in starting your business . you will of course need to pay local and federal taxes on the money you make . but since it is money you would n't have had otherwise , giving a little of it to uncle sam won't hurt . please contact the internal revenue service for any questions you have concerning applicable taxes . even though i am confident that a little effort will make you a success in this business , i can make no guarantees and none should be implied . actual profits made may be lower , equal to , or exceed the amounts mentioned in this letter . i would wish you luck , but i do n't feel luck is as important as making good decisions and having determination .
