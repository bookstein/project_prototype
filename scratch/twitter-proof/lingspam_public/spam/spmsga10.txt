Subject: auto insurance rates too high ?

dear nlpeople , i ' m sure you ' ll agree auto insurance costs too much . even with a good driving record , " routine " rate increases can drive your costs through the roof . i have discovered a way many people can sign up with an excellent company that gives amazingly low rates . they are about half of most of the rates i ' ve found shopping around for insurance in southern california . most people either qualify or have a friend who qualifies who would love to know about it . if you do n't qualify , i have another company that operates in several western states that is cheaper than many companies who claim they have " the lowest rates available . " just send $ 2 cash to : pva 1257 n kenmore ave # 2 los angeles , ca 90029 fold it in a piece of paper with your e - mail address and i will rush the information to you right away . if you prefer a hardcopy printout , enclose a self-addressed , stamped envelope . p . s . as a bonus i include two mechanic 's tips that save lots of time on a certain common repair job , and give you a quick and easy way to check the general condition of an engine . i have n't found these in any repair manuals or books before . these are great for home mechanics !
