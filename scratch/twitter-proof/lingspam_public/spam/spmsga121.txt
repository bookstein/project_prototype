read the 1st paragraph ! if you are convinced that this is not for you , then delete it . my bet is that you will be intrigued enough to finish reading it before you make your decision . financial success brochure dear fellow advertiser : my name is tim brody and i make a living selling a recipe for potato cheese pierogies . this is all i do , and i earn in excess of $ 100 , 000 each year . incredible you say ? now , i am revealing my secret to you . incredible , you say ? it is completely legal and , you too , can be well on your way to earning $ 100 , 000 per year by selling your product , plans , recipe or information through the mail . before i reveal my plan to you , let me tell you a little about myself . five years ago , i placed a classified ad in a food magazine to earn a little extra money . my response was 11 orders and 43 " get rich quick " schemes . now , please don t laugh , over the next three years i tried all of those " get rich quick " schemes . some actually met with success while many met with complete failure . with each try , i learned something new about marketing my product . finally , this plan came together and in the first 3 months , i made over $ 25 , 000 . after i tried it again , i earned $ 35 , 000 and it became clear to me that i was on my way to financial freedom . now please , this story is not merely to brag . i want you to realize the hard work , persistence and expense that went in to making this program a success . it is also my way of teaching others the problems of many marketing plans , and , hopefully , they will be able to avoid many of my own mistakes and expenses . this program is not for everyone . if you are planning to make a million dollars or to compete with your fellow participants , then this plan is not for you . however , if earning $ 100 , 000 a year in a stress-free program interests you , please read on , you are among the sincere people needed to make this program a success . maybe you have participated in some of those " get rich quick " programs before . you probably were dissatisfied with your response rate from the classifieds or mailings ? were you expecting to receive additional income but didn t even receive enough responses to pay for the ad or the stamps ? if you are like others , the answer is yes ! please do not give up hope just yet . there is a way to make money and have fun , as well as fine tune your culinary taste . join a network of buyers and sellers with similar goals for no additional costs . the process is called multi - level marketing and it is not illegal . ( see section 18 , title 1301 , 1302 & 1342 of the us postal and lottery code . ) it is a modified plan similar to that of companies such as tupperware and mary kay . best of all , it can earn advertisers like ourselves , thousands in a few months . what exactly is multi-level marketing ( mlm ) ? mlm requires that you send letters to fellow advertisers ( we will help you with the addresses ) asking that they buy your product with the understanding that once they do , they will be included as a member of your program . ( just as tupperware or avon requests salespeople to buy their products to " show " to their customers . ) the letter you send always has your name on it along with 2 - 8 advertisers . it is based on this premise : ( assuming a 3 member list and a 100 % response ) level # 1 - you send out 20 letters with your name in the # 1 position . 20 people reply . level # 2 - those 20 replies send out letters with your name in the # 2 position . 400 people reply level # 3 - those 400 replies send out letters with your name in the # 3 position . 8000 people reply . you receive a total of 8 , 420 replies and are unable to receive more , because once your name reaches the bottom of any list , it is eliminated and replaced by new members . if you asked for $ 10 for your product , you earn $ 84 , 000 . of course a 100 % response rate is unrealistic , instead expect between $ 35 , 000 and $ 60 , 000 . now , before you decide that this is the dumbest thing you have ever heard of and decide to throw this away , please look at the statistic : 91 % of all classified advertisers join one or more of these programs . why ? because they are sincere in wanting to make money ! otherwise , they would not have advertised in the beginning . knowing this fact , i know that you would like to read on . by now , you have received many letters of this type . this alone should prove that these programs are working . do me a favor , save this and all of the other letters . when you have the time , sit down and compare all the programs . your financial success depends on your making the best choice . if you are like most newcomers , your first instinct is to join the program that offers the most money or offers the cheapest price per product . before you do this , i ask that you think and answer the following questions about each program : 1 . how many participants are on the list ? the more names there are , the more responses you will need . an average 8 person list requires 1 , 500 , 000 responses before obtaining $ 100 , 000 for each participant . a 3 member list needs 3 , 500 responses . 2 . how much do i receive per product ? if you join a $ 2 . 00 plan , know beforehand that you will need 5 times the amount of replies as a $ 10 . 00 program . the $ 2 . 00 plan will also take 6 months longer for you to receive big money , obviously because you need more responses . 3 . do the words cheat-proof and monitored appear on the plan ? if the program is based on honesty and integrity alone , it will fail . face it , when it comes to money , very few people can be honest . cheat - proof means that there is a way to insure that every member gets paid . whereas monitored means that members are watching to make certain that the list never gets altered . this can be done ! also know that you are receiving many $ 2 . 00 plans , not because they are popular , but because the members must keep resending information to meet their goals . . . only 6 % of all advertisers join $ 2 . 00 programs . you probably have received only a few $ 5 and $ 10 programs . these plans work ! there is no need to send hundreds of letters and monitoring is effective . 4 . how much money do i want to earn , and how much is my initial investment ? if you want to earn $ 50 , 000 for example , know that you need 25 , 000 $ 2 . 00 responses . when you figure your investment , make sure it includes printing and stamps . if a plan will not accept checks , it is not legitimate . finally , narrow your choices and choose the best program to suit your needs . hopefully , you will see that , like 76 % of us , this one is the best choice . our program this is a cheat-proof 3 - level plan . we pay $ 10 for the product of each member on the list . you will only be required to send out 20 letters ( how to get names is supplied ) and your total investment is $ 40 ( including postage and printing ) . you only need 4 replies throughout the entire program and you ve lost nothing ! plus , we offer a bonus plan in which you can earn $ 20 , 000 more with no extra effort ! your earnings are based on the 3 - step plan outlined in the prior page . if we receive a 100 % response rate , we can all earn $ 84 , 000 ! of course , a 100 % participation again , is unrealistic . members are reporting $ 35 , 000 - $ 60 , 000 within 2 months ( without the bonus plan ) . how do i join ? on the bottom of this page , write your name , address and product , as you want it to appear on this mailer . please print clearly . make 3 copies of the following information that includes 1 ) other participants , 2 ) your name , address and product and 3 ) the control number . wrap a $ 10 check , money order or cash inside of each copy and send one to each of the following people with a self-addressed , stamped envelope . keep the original for your tax records ; it is a legitimate business expense . do not cheat by sending out only one payment . only 1 of the 3 has the required information you will need to proceed . within days , you will receive your products , instructions and this mailer with your name listed as one of the three participants . you will then send out 20 of these mailers to others . within a week , you will begin to receive your money , and within 4 weeks you will have earned over $ 25 , 000 ! it s that easy ! join today ! 1 . j . dolbow 2089 waterbury se kentwood , mi 49508 ( sweetish no - names ) 2 . l . shock 7438 sawmill rd . # 458 columbus , oh 43235 ( amy s famous chicken ) 3 . s . butler po box 770074 coral springs , fl 33077-0074 ( delicious potato salad ) your name _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ your address _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ city , state , zip _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ your product _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ control number 187329 * your total cost for this program is $ 40 . 00 ( $ 30 . 00 to members , $ 3 printing , $ 7 stamps ) . there are no other fees . * canadian residents ask that you please remember to use 2 first class stamps when mailing to them . believe me , the extra stamps are worth it . they are some of our best participants ! * if paying by check , please allow 7 additional days to allow the check to clear . important information to ensure that you keep this legal and honest , be sure to file schedule c profit or loss from business with your income tax return . report all income you receive and deduct all business related expenses . these tax deductible business expenses can include vehicle ownership ( in your company s name ) , expenses , travel and entertainment , business equipment , purchases for your business , supplies , telephone , postage , advertising costs , rent , wages ( other than your own ) , legal and professional services , and business taxes . these can be legally deducted if they are related to your business .
