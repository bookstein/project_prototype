Subject: improvements in wound care !

hello , my name is kevin elphick and i am the managing director of nursing innovations which have been manufacturing and supplying a range of innovative wound dressing protectors named ' keep - dri dressings ' to australian hospitals for a period in excess of 8 years . these internationally award winning products are now extensively used in over 70 % of western australian hospitals ( references available upon request ) and we are now looking at supplying to hospitals internationally . however , we have found from experience it is difficult to initially introduce the product to hospitals . once a hospital starts using keep - dri dressings they have always continued to use them . our success is related to the fact that they are quick and easy to apply ( saving staff time ) and they really work . the result is lower infection risk , reduced patient trauma and lower cost for the hospital . for your free sample contact me at my web site http : / / www . angelfire . com / ca2 / nursingone here you will find a full product description , uses and advantages and a link to my email address . i would appreciate any suggestions you might have to help introduce this excellent product into hospitals in your area or comments you have on our product . many thanks in advance . kevin elphick nursing innovations 23 yulema street mullaloo , perth , western australia 6027 618-9487 - 1807 http : / / www . angelfire . com / ca2 / nursingone * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * k
