pkdd ' 98 - - 2nd european symposium on principles of data mining and knowledge discovery nantes , france september 23-26 , 1998 http : / / www . sciences . univ-nantes . fr / pkdd98 data mining and knowledge discovery in databases ( kdd ) have emerged from acombination of many research areas : databases , statistics , machinelearning , automated scientific discovery , inductive logic programming , artificial intelligence , visualization , decision science , and high performance computing . while each of these areas can contribute in specific ways , kdd focuses on the value that is added by creative combination of the contributing areas . the goal of pkdd ' 98 is to provide a european - based forum for interaction among all theoreticians and practitioners interested in data mining . interdisciplinary collaboration is one desired outcome , but the main long-term focus is on theoretical principles for the emerging discipline of kdd , especially on kdd - specific principles that go beyond each contributing area . both theoretical and applied submissions are sought . reviewers will assess the contribution towards the principles of kdd , in addition to the usual requirements of relevance , novelty , clarity and significance . applied papers should go beyond an individual application , presenting an explicit method that promises a degree of generality within one or more stages of the discovery process , such as preprocessing , mining , visualization , use of prior knowledge , knowledge refinement , and evaluation . theoretical papers should demonstrate how the proposed theoretical contribution advances the discovery process . the following non-exclusive list exemplifies topics of interest : data and knowledge representation for data mining * beyond relational databases : new forms of data organization * data reduction * prior domain knowledge and use of discovered knowledge * combining query systems with discovery capabilities statistics and probability in data mining * discovery of probabilistic networks * modelling knowledge uncertainty * discovery of exceptions and deviations * statistical significance in large-scale search * the problems of over-fit logic - based perspective on data mining * inference of knowledge from data * exploring different subspaces of first order logic * rough sets in data mining * boolean approaches to data mining * inductive logic programming for mining real databases * pattern - recognition for data mining * the use of tolerance ( similarity ) relations in data mining * kdd - motivated discretization of data * discovery of approximate schemes of reasoning from data man - machine interaction in data mining * visualization of data * visualization of knowledge * interface design * interactive data mining : human and computer contributions artificial intelligence contributions to kdd * representing knowledge and hypotheses spaces * search for knowledge and its complexities * combining many methods in one system * data mining in distributed / multiagent systems high performance computing for data mining * hardware support for kdd * parallel discovery algorithms and complexity * distributed data mining * scalability in high dimensional datasets * from concept learning to concept discovery * expanding the autonomy of machine learners * embedding learning methods in kdd systems * conceptual clustering in knowledge discovery * applications of scientific discovery systems to databases * scientific hypothesis evaluation that transfers to kdd * hypothesis spaces of scientific discovery applied in kdd * differences between the data handled in both fields * kdd applications on scientific databases * decomposition of large data tables quality assessment of data mining results * multi - criteria knowledge evaluation * benchmarks and metrics for system evaluation * statistical tests in kdd applications * usefulness and risk assessment in decision-making applications of data mining and knowledge discovery * medicine : diagnosis and prognosis * control theory : predictive and adaptive control , model identification * engineering : diagnosis of mechanisms and processes * public administration * marketing and finance * data mining on the web in text and heterogeneous data * natural and social science * prediction and intervention use of knowledge * fraud detection interaction between symbolic kdd methods and neural nets * interpretation of knowledge accumulated in a trained nn * hybrid nn / symbolic kdd systems * nn architectures for higher transparency and interpretability submitted papers should be in english and not exceed 10 single-spaced pages of 12pt font ( excluding title page but including tables , figures and bibliography ) . submissions exceeding this limit will not be reviewed . a separate title page should begin with title , authors , affiliations , surface and e-mail addresses , and an abstract of about 200 words . submitted papers should preferably be formatted according to the lnai guidelines . latex and word style files are available at http : / / www . sciences . univ-nantes . fr / pkdd98 / styles . the following items must be submitted by may 15th , 1998 : an electronic version of the paper ( uuencoded and compressed postscript ) , and an electronic version of the titlepage in plain ascii format . four hard copies of the paper by regular mail are also accepted if electronic submission is not possible . all items should be sent to the following addresses : * regular mail : mohamed quafafou -
