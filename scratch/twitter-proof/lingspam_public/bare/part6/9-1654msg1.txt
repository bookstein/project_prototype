call for squibs > from lisa cheng and rint sybesma , editors of glot international next year glot international will start featuring a squib section . we invite everybody to send us squibs on any subject in any field of " theoretical " linguistics . since we appear monthly ( almost ! ) and our production time is relatively short , we will be able to publish squibs very soon after their acceptance . the review procedure we have set up is also geared at losing as little time as possible . what squibs are ? what squibs do ? squibs inspire . they present ideas , yet to be fleshed out but one at the time . they find connections between facts that nobody ever thought were related . they spell out the beginning of a new analysis , not necessarily daring . they give you new facts from old languages and old facts in a new guise . they come up with beautiful observations that somehow seem theoretically relevant as well . they tell you about wonderful problems and possibly only hint at a solution . and they have the length of one page in glot international , which is about 1500 words ( including the references ! ) . if you are interested in submitting a squib , please send us three hard copies and one soft copy to the addresses below . however , before sending us anything , please consult the guidelines for authors on the our web site ( www . hagpub . com / glot . htm ) or send us an e-mail if you prefer to receive the guidelines by e-mail or regular mail . our addresses : e-mail : glot @ rullet . leidenuniv . nl regular mail : lisng and rint sybesma glot international department of general linguistics leiden university p . o . box 9515 2300 ra leiden the netherlands * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * lisa cheng and rint sybesma editors glot international hil / department of general linguistics leiden university po box 9515 2300 ra leiden the netherlands fax : + 31-70 - 448-0177 http : / / www . hagpub . com / glot . htm
