Subject: re : check this out !

dear friend , greetings ! hopefully my name is on the list below . i am a retired attorney , and about two years ago a man came to me with a letter . the letter he brought me is basically the same letter you havve in your hands . he asked me to verify that this letter was legal . i told him i would review it and get back to him . when i first read the letter i thought it was some off the wall idea to make money . a week and a half later we met in my offic to discuss the issue . i told him the letter he brought me was not 100 % legal and advised him to make a small change so it would be . i was still curious about the letter and he told me how it works . i thought it was a longshot so i decided against participation , but before my client left i asked him to keep me updated as to his results . about two months later , he called me to tell me he had received over $ 800 , 000 in cash ! i did n't believe him , so he suggested i try his idea to find out for myself . i thought about it for a couple of weeks and decided i had nothing to lose . i asked him for a copy of the letter and followed the instructions exactly , mailed out 200 copies and sure enough , the money started arriving ! it came slowly at first but after three weeks i was getting more mail than i could open in a day ! after about three months the money stopped coming . i kept a precise copy of my earnings and at the end of the three months they totaled $ 968 , 493 ! i was earning a good living as a lawyer , but as anyone in the legal profession will tell you , there is a lot of stress that comes with the job . i decided to try the letter again but this time sent out 500 letters . well , three months later , my earnings totaled $ 2 , 344 , 178 ! i just could not believe it , i met with my old client for lunch to find out how it worked . what made this one different from others were that there are six names on the list , not five like most others . that fact alone results in your name being on far more returns . the other factor was the help i gave him in ensuring the whole thing was legal , since nobody wants to risk doing something illegal . i ' ll bet by now you are curious to know what little change i told him to make . well , if you send a letter like this out , to make it legal you must actually sell something if you expect to receive something in return . so , when you send a dollar to each of the six people on the list , you must include a slip of paper with the words , " please put me on your mailing list " and enclose your mailing address . you need not include your name . this is the legal key to this program ! the item you received for the dollar you send the six names below is this letter and the right to earn thousands ! follow the simple instructions below exactly , and in three months you should receive over $ 800 , 000 ! ! ! $ 800 , 000 in less than 90 days ! ! ! guaranteed ! ! here is the business capital you need ! act now and be finacially solvent by the year 1999 ! ! this is a method of raising capital that really works every time , 100 percent . i ' m sure you could use the money in the next 20 to 90 day . s please study this carfully . this is not a chain letter ! this is a perfectly legal money making opportunity that will cost you a couple of rolls of stamps , a mailing list and six bucks . follow these instructions exactly and you will receive $ 800 , 000 in cash from business minded individuals just like yourself . 1 . immediately send $ 1 . 00 to each of the names below , and a note requesting you be added to their mailing lists . it is this important step that makes the system legal 2 . omit the name in the number 1 position and move each of the other names up one place ( number 2 becomes number 1 , number 3 becomes number 2 , 4 becomes number 3 etc . ) put your own name and address in the sixth position ( an easy way to do this is to type the six names , with your own name as number six , on a separate sheet of paper and tape over the area where the names are printed . ) 3 . print out 200 copies of these pages with the new list of names that you have created . your name now in the sixth position , in place of the current list of names . 4 . purchase a mailing list from the dataline co . or any other mail list sellers . most names list sell 200 names for only $ 26 . 00 . the best part is that the list of names come on self-adhesive labels that easily peel and stick to the envelope . just call 1-800 - 497-2912 . * * * mailing lists are also available from list associates at 1-888 - 359-2621 or mailing lists at 954-742 - 9519 . or check on the internet for other mail brokers . 5 . while waiting for the mailing list to arrive , place each of your 200 copies into business sized envelopes and seal them . go to the post office and purchase 200 . 32 cent stamps and place them on the envelopes . do not put your return address on the envelopes . . . this will peak the curiosity of the recipient . 6 . once your list arrives , place an address label on each of the 200 envelopes and drop them in the mailbox . within 20 to 90 days you will recieve over $ 800 , 000 in cash - and its all yours ! now comes the interesting part . . that 's with only a 7 . 5 % response rate ( which is very conservative . it 's more than possible to reach the amount every time ! ) the first time i participated my response rate was 9 . 5 % . my second was over 11 % 7 . keep this letter so you can use it as many times as you wish . using the addresses that people send you can raise the response rate because they also wish to conitine receiving more capital . * * this system was made for the purpose of accumulating capital fast and honestly . once again , this is not a chain letter , but perfectly legal ( refer to title 18 , sections 1302 and 1341 of the united states postal and lottery laws ) . when you send out 200 copies of this letter , each responsive individual sends out 200 copies and send you $ 1 . 00 , thereby multiplying your fortune very rapidly ! examine the chart of how this system is the best in america for raising capital ! ! ! * * you mail 200 letters , multiply that by 7 . 5 % return rate = 15 people + $ 15 * * 15 people mail out 200 letters x 7 . 5 % = 225 people = $ 225 * * 225 people mail out 200 letters x 7 . 5 % = 3375 people = $ 3375 * * 3375 people mail out 200 letters x 7 . 5 % = 50 , 625 people = $ 50 , 625 * * 50 , 625 people mail 200 letters x 7 . 5 % = 759 , 375 people = $ 759 , 375 * * * at this point your name drops off the list , but so far you ' ve received $ 813 , 615 ! ! ! * be sure to mail $ 1 . 00 to each of teh six names on the list * 1 . john salinas 100 deseret dr . , pasco , wa 99301 2 . elizabeth potts 7714 west jenan dr , peoria , az 85345 3 . lavonda walton 4005 parkway apt . # 11 , temple hills , md 20748 4 . murry mcneal 316 rachels trail , st . peters , mo 63376 5 . joseph swenson 544 1 / 2 7th ave w . , kalispell , mt 59901 6 . suzy krogman po box 802167 , santa clarita , ca 91380 this system is guaranteed to work 100 percent of the time in raising capital , but , if you remove any other name aside from the one in the number one position , you will not be covered by the title 18 in the u . s . postal law . the best part about this is you won't be hurting anyone . it will take only about $ 100 to participate . it is legal , so make money honestly and start today !
