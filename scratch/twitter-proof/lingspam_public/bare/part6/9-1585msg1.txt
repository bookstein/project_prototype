Subject: semantics ; a network theory of reference , kiyoshi ishikawa

a network theory of reference kiyoshi ishikawa ( hosei university ) noting specific inadequacies with truth-conditional approaches , ishikawa develops a dynamic theory of reference incorporating features of discourse representation theory , file change semantics and situation semantics , and also deals with non-monotonic belief revision . he argues that the task of natural language semantics is to describe meaning in terms of the psychological relation of language to our cognition of external reality . in his approach , a linguistic expression 's meaning is its potential to change the information state of a cognitive agent . reference is not understood as a link to a real individual external to an agent , but as the agent 's act to link a character in a linguistic frame of individuation to characters in other ( linguistic or nonlinguistic ) frames . as the target of inquiry , the distinction between referential and attributive uses of definite descriptions is analyzed through the construction of conversation scenarios . in addition , ishikawa extends his theory to an analysis of belief and attitude reports . application of the theory to cleft and pseudocleft constructions is also outlined . presented in a very accessible style , ishikawa 's theory will be of interest to scholars in cognitive science / artificial intelligence and philosophy as well as linguistics .
