syntax new from holland academic graphics : mood at the interface by josep quer mood at the interface offers a unified study of the grammatical contribution of mood in the whole spectrum of subordination . the basic hypothesis of the work is that indicative / subjunctive alternations constitute the overt marking of a shift in the model where a prop - osition is evaluated . it is shown that such an account in terms of mood shift succeeds in providing a wide empirical coverage for this rather murky domain and supplies a strong argument for the interac - tion of this verbal category with the different components of the grammar . the study concentrates on romance languages , with special emphasis on catalan and spanish . contents : 1 . subjunctive a dependent mood 2 . subjunctive types and argument clauses 3 . mood and the interpretation of relative clauses 4 . free relatives and free choice readings 5 . adjuncts as restrictors : mood shifts in concessives and concessive conditionals 6 . concluding remarks 1998 . xvi + 296 pp . isbn 90-5569 - 044 - 9 . paperback .
