new from holland academic graphics : anneke nunn dutch orthography a systematic investigation of the spelling of dutch words this study offers a detailed and systematic account of dutch orthography and its relation to the linguistic system . it reveals aspects of the spelling system that were ignored or left implicit until now , and integrates them with what was already known from prescriptive and descriptive accounts . the most important insight this study yields is that the dutch spelling system consists of two distinct components : phoneme-to - grapheme conversion rules and autonomous spelling rules . thus , the computation of spelling from sound representations is a two-step process . the investigation also shows that the phoneme-to - grapheme conversion rules for non-native words should be distinguished from the rules for native words . the autonomous spelling rules apply to both sets of lexical items alike , however . dutch spelling rules were modelled by means of a computer programme and applied to the sound representations of dutch words . 1998 . 237 pp . isbn 90-5569 - 049 - x . paperback .
