Subject: query : future tense discourses

hi everybody , i am looking for texts written in the german future tense ( yes , i do believe there is such a thing ! ) . could anybody help me out with references ? i want to compare the frequency of temporal adverbial anaphors in future tense discourses to the frequency in past tense discourses . thus , it would be best to have novels , short stories etc . by the same autor in both tenses . thank you ! birgit hamp
