Subject: homophones in english dialects

i work with students with written language learning disabilities . my students and i create personalized editing checklists , one component of these checklists being a list of commonly confused homophones . i 'd like to compile a more comprehensive list , however . i ' ve got a copy of evan antworth 's list of homophones from standard english , but i 'd like to supplement this with homophones in dialects of english . i am particularly interested in mid - atlantic and southern dialects . thanks in advance - - suzanne cadwell
