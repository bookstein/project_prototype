Subject: resources on afrikaans

a student of mine here in japan wishes to examine the evolution of afrikaans and its relationship to dutch / german / english . source material is scarce in local libraries , and i personally have not much knowledge of the language or literature on it . both diachronic and synchronic studies would be of interest - overview and broadly drawn material would be preferable to highly technical ( e . g . , syntactic ) analysis . thank you in advance to helpful linguists who can take the time to point us beyond " the development of afrikaans " and " a grammar of afrikaans " and work by botha to further material . reply privately to guy modica < gmodica @ fh . seikei . ac . jp > .
