Subject: re : 8 . 1221 , re : double - dutch and youthese / pig latin

dear all , thanks , first of all , to kevin caldwell < kdcaldw @ interserv . com > for his interesting and informative input . since posting the summary on the list ( re : 8 . 1208 ) i have been receiving an even greater stream of responses than after my original query , including several about opish / optalk . so , it looks like i ' ll have to post a second summary when the stream relaxes . therefor , it would perhaps be easier on the list moderating editors , if you send any further reponses ( which i greatly look forward to , because they are very helpful for me ) directly to me . i ' ll be sure to include them in the second summary . thanks for the apparently quite wide interest in the subject . best regards , waruno - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - waruno mahdi tel : + 49 30 8413-5301 faradayweg 4 - 6 fax : + 49 30 8413-3155 14195 berlin email : mahdi @ fhi-berlin . mpg . de germany www : http : / / w3 . rz-berlin . mpg . de / ~ wm / - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
