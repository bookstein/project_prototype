Subject: new listserv for linguist

dear linguist subscribers : this message heralds a change in how mail will be sent to you . up till this time , mail has been distributed to you via one of the listservs at texas a&m university . the address of the listserv by which linguist mail was distributed to you was : listserv @ listserv . tamu . edu and linguist 's main address was : linguist @ listserv . tamu . edu or linguist @ tamvm1 . tamu . edu today we have completed transferring all linguist mailing operations to our own listserv , " listserv . linguistlist . org . " this is now the new mail distribution site for the linguist list . * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * from now on , therefore , if you wish to set your * * * * listserv options , you should address your requests to : * * * * * * * * listserv @ listserv . linguistlist . org * * * * the main linguist address has also changed . posts * * * * should now be sent to : * * * * * * linguist @ listserv . linguistlist . org * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * all other linguist and linguist addresses and urls remain the same . for the moment , mail will continue to be forwarded from the old linguist addresses to the new ones . all of us should be grateful to mark liberman and the linguistic data consortium at the university of pennsylvania , who provided this wonderful new machine and a listserv license to linguist . it was an extraordinarily generous gift . we hope that it will provide much improved mail delivery , especially to places outside north america . after , of course , the inevitable software bugs have been worked through ! anthony , helen and daniel
