Subject: re : 6 . 923 , sum : chomsky on letting the theory choose

chomsky 's optimism about " letting the theory decide " about unclear cases of grammaticality sharply contrasts with the view proposed by baudrillard ( in _ l ' autre par lui meme _ ) as to the role of theory in forcing reality and in defining us as theory practitioners . i ' m traslating from the spanish version : " the status of theory could only be one of challenging reality . or , rather , the relationship between the two is one of a mutual challenge . for , undoubtedly , also the real is nothing but a challenge to theory - - not an objective state of affairs , but a radical frontier for analysis , beyond which nothing obeys theory or beyond which theory no longer has anything to say . but also theory is only made to disobey reality , and it constitutes its unreachable frontier . irreconciliation between theory and the real : a corollary of the irreconciliation between subjects and their own goals . all attempts at reconciliation are deceiving and are doomed to failure .
