familiarity with natural language processing ; a flexible approach to linguistic theory ; and an advanced degree in linguistics , computer science , or a closely related discipline . native proficiency in french is assumed ; practical experience with nlp implementation issues or grammar checkers is highly desirable . about the microsoft nlp research group : we are in the process of designing and building a system to analyze unrestricted natural language , taking input text , and moving from lexical / morphological analysis through syntax , semantics , and eventually pragmatics and discourse . a generation component is also planned . as part of microsoft research , we work toward the long-term goal of broad coverage language analysis : however , we also work close-ly with product groups to integrate our technology into microsoft products . in microsoft office ' 97 , the english grammar checker is based on our technology . we are ready to develop the same system for french . we are empirically oriented , and are happy to use good linguistic ideas wherever they can be found . a reason-able first-version summary of our techniques and some of our experience can be found in the book " natural language processing : the plnlp approach , " kluwer academic publishers , boston , 1993 . for more information about the nlp group , connect to our home page on the www . http : / / www . research . microsoft . com / nlp contact : please send resumes , cover letters , and any additional materials to : steven clyne , human resources , microsoft corporation , one microsoft way , redmond , wa 98052 usa email : stevecl @ microsoft . com 272 . ucla . the ucla dept . of linguistics expects to have several short-term jobs available teaching various courses in the coming academic year ( 1997-98 ) . most of the positions are in the area of syntax , though we will hire in other areas too . these are all replacement positions , for faculty who are on leave , and there is no realistic prospect of any of them developing into permanent positions . some of the courses that need to be taught are undergraduate classes , while others are graduate classes . at least three , and possibly as many as five courses will involve syntax courses at various levels , ranging from introductory undergraduate syntactic analysis to advanced graduate seminars . our most pressing need in these areas is during the fall and winter quarters ( see below for an outline of quarter dates ) . in addition , we may need an instructor for two lower-division introductory courses in general linguistics in the winter and / or spring quarters ; one of these is a generic intro to linguistics ; the other is a course surveying the languages spoken in the usa , including immigrant languages , american indian languages , and dialects of english and spanish , covering phonetics , history , and sociolinguistic issues , among others . finally , we will have openings for advanced graduate courses in some of the subfields represented in our department - - such as phonology , phon-etics , psycholinguistics , computational ling . , syntax , semantics , specific language areas ( such as african , american indian , etc . ) for these advanced graduate courses , we are primarily interested in hiring relatively senior people with established repu-tations ( e . g . people who are on leave and who are interested in visiting ucla ) , though more junior applicants will also be considered . because we have a large number of courses available for visitors to teach next year , we are quite flexible in terms of the type and level of appointments . in particular , we may be interested in hiring some people for single-course lectureships ( paying in the neighborhood of $ 7 , 000 to $ 10 , 000 per 10 - week course , depending on seniority ) ; we may also consider full-time appointments for periods of one or two terms , with a courseload of 2 courses per term , and pay levels per course roughly comparable to those mentioned above . finally , we may make appointments with less than full-time teaching loads ( e . g . teaching one course and co-teaching another ) . these visiting positions are not restricted as to rank . we are especially interested in hiring faculty from other universities who plan to be on leave during ( part of ) the coming academic year and who may be interested in visiting our department for part of the year and teaching a course ( or two ) while they are here . each course runs for ten weeks ( with two 2 - hour lectures per week ) followed by an exam week . appli - cants should send a letter of application , including a cv , a statement of previous teaching experience , as well as the names , addresses , and phone numbers of three recommenders to : tim stowell ( chair ) , dept . of linguistics , ucla , los angeles , ca 90095-1543 . ( actual letters of recommendation should not be sent at this time ; likewise candidates should not send voluminous dossiers of publications , etc . ) applications for fall quarter courses should be received by aug . 15 1997 , and applications for winter and spring quarter courses should be received by sept . 10 1997 , though late applications will also be considered as long as the positions remain unfilled . potential applicants are strongly encouraged to inform us by e-mail , as soon as possible , of their intention to apply for these positions . initial inquiries by email may be directed to tim stowell ( stowell @ ucla . edu ) or to anna meyer ( meyer @ humnet . ucla . edu ) . eoe . = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = fyi ( " for your information " ) / / cheers , ach = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = > > > > > > alan c . harris , ph . d . telnos : main off : 818-677 - 2853 professor , communication / linguistics direct off : 818-677 - 2874 speech communication department california state university , northridge home : 818-366 - 3165 spch csun fax : 818-677 - 2663 northridge , ca 91330-8257 internet email : alan . harris @ csun . edu www homepage : http : / / www . csun . edu / ~ vcspc005 = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = =
