Subject: case-marked locatives

does anyone know about locative elements such as english _ there _ which are ( overtly ) case-marked , i . e . have a different form when used as subjects and objects ? if so , are there cases where the locative is also used as an expletive ( as in the english : _ there _ came a man ) ? please reply to me ( starke @ uni2a . unige . ch or the above one ) and i will post a summary , thanks michal starke .
