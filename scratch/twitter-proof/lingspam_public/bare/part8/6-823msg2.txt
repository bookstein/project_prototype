Subject: romanizations

i am looking for references for " linguisitcally minded " and / or standard romanizations to be used to produce orthographies of the following languages : arabic cantonese korean farsi hindi tamil all characters used in the romanization must be found on a standard keyboard . there needs to be a mapping between the original orthography and the romanization - - the romanization can contain more linguistic " smarts " than the original orthography . i ' ll post a summary of responses if it seems appropriate . so far i ' ve been looking at : arabic : for arabic if have been looking at the romanization used in the " english - arabic conversational dictionary " by richard jaschke , which claims to be " one of the best pocket guides to arabic ever published " cantonese : lshk ( linguistic society of hong kong , 1993 ) ( i ' m leaning toward this one . . . ) sidney lau korean : hangul ( i like this one . . . anyone ever had any negative experience with it ? ) farsi : i do n't have much for this but a little book called " colloquial persian " by leila moshiri . hindi : no reference , but i have made what i think may be a decent romanization . . . is there a standard ? none of the native speakers in my neck of the woods seems to know of one . . . tamil : pretty empty here . . . . .
