Subject: passives

hi all , does anyone know of a language in which passives are more frequent than actives ? it seems that it is possible to find languages in which actives are more frequent than passives , and even languages in which passives do not exist , but does the third case occur in any natural language ? any help on this would be greatly appreciated ? ll
