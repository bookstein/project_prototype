Subject: finding email addresses : advice

there seem to be pretty frequent requests for email addresses on the linguist list . people with unix accounts can use the " finger " command to look up addresses - - if they know the name and affiliation of the person they ' re looking for ( others may have access to some sort of finger utility ) . for example , there was a recent request for the internet address of someone whose bitnet address is escatton @ albnyvms here 's how i used finger to find his internet address : finger escatton @ albnyvms finger : albnyvms : unknown host finger escatton @ albnyvms . edu finger : albnyvms . edu : unknown host well , albnyvms does n't sound very internet-like , so let 's start guessing : finger scatton @ albany . edu [ albany . edu ] ( there is no account scatton on this node . ) name : ernest scatton title : professor , german and slavic languages + literat address : humanities 246 university at albany 1400 washington av albany ny 12222-0001 phone : + 1 518-442 - 4224 bitnet : escatton @ albnyvms internet : escatton @ cnsvax . albany . edu there it is . if you have less information - - for example , you know the person is somewhere in new york state , but not where exactly - - you can use one of the " white pages " services available . a good starting point is : http : / / home . netscape . com / commun / internet _ white _ pages . html happy hunting !
