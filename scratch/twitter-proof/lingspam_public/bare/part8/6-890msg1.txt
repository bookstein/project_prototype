Subject: bangani

i am looking for any information and / or bibliographical references on an indian language called bangani . this language apparently has preserved some remarkable archaisms , and would appear from the available data in fact not to be an indo - aryan language . the only information i know of on the language appears in two articles by claus peter zoller in mss 49 and 50 , 1988 and 1989 . daniel baum the hebrew university of jerusalem jerusalem israel dmbaum @ shani . net
