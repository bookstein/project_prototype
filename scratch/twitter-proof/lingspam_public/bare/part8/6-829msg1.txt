Subject: genderless ?

content - length : 350 in some languages which are standarly described as genderless it is still the case , i am pretty sure , that people say things like ' that woman ' instead of 's he ' and because this looks like a purely lexical matter , the appearance of genderlessness is preserved . i wonder if this applies to the languages recently described as genderless on this list .
