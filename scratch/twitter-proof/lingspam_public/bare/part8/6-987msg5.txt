Subject: case studies needed

dear colleagues , i ' m preparing to teach an introductory course in language variation , and i 'd like to get your help ( again ) . could you recommend any case studies , either from published sources or from your own experience , that would be appropriate for class discussion ? what i ' m looking for in a case study is a description of a real situation , preferably a somewhat controversial one . ideally , it would include some background information , a description of the conflicts involved , the sequence of events up to a point where a decision is needed , and a description of the actual decision taken . since the course is on language variation , relevant case studies would include anecdotes on discrimination in the workplace or in the educational system because of language choice or dialect choice , or cases involving difficult decisions in language planning or language legislation . i ' ve never used case studies before , so advice and comments are also welcome ! my address is mkuha @ silver . ucs . indiana . edu thanks for your help . mai kuha
