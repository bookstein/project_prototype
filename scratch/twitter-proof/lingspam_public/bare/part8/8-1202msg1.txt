Subject: re : q : identifying ungrammatical sentences

we have designed and developed an incremental parsing system called screen which processes spoken language using a hybrid learning architecture . the system receives spoken input and produces a flat syntactic , semantic and dialog analysis . this is performed in an incremental left to right parsing regime . part of the system is also a correction component which deals with incremental ungrammatical phenomena , like interjections , word repairs , repetitions , phrase corrections . if you are interested there is a jair journal article and an animation available from the home page below . this article also contains many more references on incremental grammatical processing . hope this helps , best wishes , stefan wermter * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * dr . stefan wermter international computer science institute 1947 center street , suite 600 berkeley , ca 94704-1198 usa phone : ( 510 ) 642-4274 - 185 ( office ) phone : ( 510 ) 528 5009 ( home ) voicemail : ( 510 ) 642-4274 - 899 fax : ( 510 ) 643-7684 email : wermter @ icsi . berkeley . edu http : / / www . informatik . uni-hamburg . de / nats / staff / wermter . html * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *
