Subject: huron

i am doing research about indigenous languages for a writer at the banff centre . he is looking for a specific article but can only provide me with the following information : he knows that the huron language is considered an endangered language . but , he has been informed by a linguist friend of an article written about an elderly man living in the detroit area who learned this language as a boy from his grand-mother in the 1920 's . this man does not wish to speak with people or take inquiries . however , an article was written about him and his experiences . there was hope that this article was printed in _ orion nature quarterly _ magazine sometime in 1995 . the editor was contacted , but has not yet responded . without a complete citation , i cannot request a copy of this article , if one was written on this subject . does anyone have any information on this topic or this specific article ? i would really appreciate any information that you can provide or point me to . there is however a rush on this request . i would appreciate any information by july 31 , 1997 . thank you very much , nadia mazzuca - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - email : nadia _ mazzuca @ banffcentre . ab . ca the banff centre library banff , ab canada
