Subject: new book : cognitive linguistics

the new psychology of language cognitive and functional approaches to language structure edited by michael tomasello , emory university the history of psychological approaches to the study of language has included periods of little communication between the disciplines of linguistics and psychology , and periods where each field drew upon the theories and methods of the other in limited - - and often limiting - - ways . this book represents a new approach that may define the next era in the relationship between psychology and linguistics . it does so by presenting the evolving linguistic theories collectively known as cognitive - functional linguistics in terms that are intended to be accessible to cognitive scientists interested in how language works psychologically . in contrast to the chomskian linguistic theories with which most psychologists today are familiar , the cognitive-functional approach of these linguists focuses on the things people communicate about ( communicative functions ) and the social conventions by means of which they do so ( linguistic symbols and structures ) . the chapters in this book were all written by linguists who are leading proponents of this approach and edited by a psychologist committed to bringing this new way of looking at language into the mainstream of psychology . the volume promises to give psychologists a new appreciation of what this variety of linguistics can offer their study of language and communication , as well as to provide cognitive-functional linguists new models for presenting their work to audiences outside the boundaries of traditional linguistics . 0-8058 - 2576 - 2 [ cloth ] / 1998 / 312pp . / $ 65 . 00 0-8058 - 2577 - 0 [ paper ] / 1998 / 312pp . / $ 29 . 95 lawrence erlbaum associates , inc . orders @ erlbaum . com
