runner , jeffrey t . ; noun phrase licensing ; 0-8153 - 3134 - 7 , cloth ; pages , $ 62 ; garland publishing ; outstanding dissertations in linguistics this book examines the syntax of direct object noun phrases in english within the principles and parameters , specifically chomsky 's minimalist program , approach to generative grammar . the main focus is on the phrase structural positions of object noun phrases at the various levels of representation , and secondarily on the relationship between structural position and semantic interpretation . supported by a variety of empirical and conceptual arguments , the central claim of the book is that direct object noun phrases in english surface in a vp - external position ; a secondary claim is that while in the overt syntax direct objects appear vp - externally , their position at the level of " logical form " varies depending on interpretation . four basic constructions are studied : simple transitive clauses , transitive clauses with prepositional objects , the " raising to object " construction , and the " double object " construction . the particular mismatches observed between overt and covert syntax are argued to follow from a non-movement - based mapping among levels of representation ; specifically the author employs and further develops the " copy and delete " approach to movement which , combined with general principles regulating the licensing of phrases at various levels of representation , accounts for the observed mismatches , as well as neatly extending to two further constructions : the existential and stylistic inversion constructions . this book will be of interest to scholars in the areas of phrase structure syntax , english and germanic syntax , the syntax-semantics interface , and all areas of generative approaches to syntax . e - mail : info @ garland . com
