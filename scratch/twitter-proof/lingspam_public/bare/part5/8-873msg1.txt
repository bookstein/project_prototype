Subject: new uci dissertation in linguistics

irvine linguistics students association is pleased to announce the publication of the following uci dissertation in linguistics . overt movement as a reflex of morphology hajime ikawa under the framework of the minimalist program , this thesis answers fundamental questions with overt movement such as ( i ) what forces its application , and ( ii ) what is responsible for its presence / absence in languages . chapter 1 raises the above-mentioned fundamental questions with overt movement . it is shown that the current minimalist framework , as it is , does not explain any of them in a principled way . chapter 2 introduces two major operations assumed by the minimalist program , merge and move . chapter 3 first undertakes to identify the cause of overt movement in a way consistent with the basic minimalist assumption that any application of overt movement , as a departure from the best case , should be forced from the outside of the core computational system . it is claimed that overt movement is directly driven by the module morphology , which applies right after spell - out ; overt movement , whether head-movement or xp - movement , is forced to apply to morphologically support the suffixal functional heads . this claim automatically leads to derive the absence of overt movement in consistently head-final languages like japanese from their word order . the proposed analysis not only provides principled answers for the fundamental questions with overt movement , but eliminates one of the most problematic aspects of the minimalist program , the strong / weak distinction among functional heads . chapter 4 discusses various implications and consequences of the proposed analysis for overt movement , phrase structure , the computational system , and typological variations . chapter 5 discusses overt np - raising as overt movement indirectly driven by the morphological properties of agr . it is claimed that a subject in nominative-accusative languages overtly raises not to directly support agr , but to provide f-features for agr so that it can be successfully suffixed to a verb as the overt realization of the f-features of an np . from this , asymmetries between overt np - raising and other overt movements directly driven by morphology naturally follow . also available : > uci dissertations in linguistics griffith , teresa a . 1996 projecting transitivity and agreement takano , yuji 1996 movement and parametric variation in syntax zoerner , cyril edward 1995 coordination : the syntax of &p us $ 14 each , plus shipping and handling > uci working papers in linguistics , volume 3 ( 1997 ) . edited by luther > chen - sheng liu and kazue takeda articles appearing in the third volume are : brian agbayani : category raising , adjunction , and minimality lisa lai - shen cheng : " partial " wh - movement naoki fukui : attract and the a - over - a principle toru ishii : the " crossing " constraint and the minimal link condition luther chen - sheng liu : light verb and accusative - ing gerund in taiwanese yuji takano : object shift as short scrambling kazue takeda : a note on locality of category movement and feature movement sze - wing tang : the parametric approach to the resultative construction in chinese and english miyoko yashui : identification of ellipses and other empty categories us $ 14 , plus shipping and handling > uci working papers in linguistics , volume 2 : proceedings of the south > western optimality theory workshop ( swot ii ) . edited by brian agbayani > and naomi harada us $ 12 , plus shipping and handling > uci working papers in linguistics , volume 1 . edited by brian agbayani , > kazue takeda and sze - wing tang us $ 12 , plus shipping and handling shipping and handling ( per item ) domestic : $ 5 ;
