( http : / / www . cs . ucy . ac . cy / sac99 . html ) sac ' 99 : ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ over the past thirteen years , the acm symposium on applied computing ( sac ) has become a primary forum for applied computer scientists and application developers from around the world to interact and present their work . sac ' 99 is sponsored by the acm special interest groups sigada , sigapp , sigbio , and sigcue . authors are invited to contribute original papers in all areas of experimental computing and application development for the technical sessions . there will be a number of special tracks on such issues as programming languages , parallel and distributed computing , mobile and scientific computing , internet and the www , etc . coordination models , languages and applications track : ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ a special track on coordination models , languages and applications will be held at sac ' 99 . the term " coordination " here is used in a rather broad sense covering traditional models and languages ( e . g . ones based on the shared dataspace and cham metaphors ) but also other related formalisms such as configuration and architectural description frameworks , systems modeling abstractions and languages , programming skeletons , etc . this track on coordination is held for the second time as part of acm sac 's events . the cfp for the acm sac ' 98 track attracted 33 submissions from 18 countries ; 8 of those submissions were accepted as regular papers and 4 more as short papers . major topics of interest include but are not limited to the following : * novel models , languages , programming and implementation techniques . * relationship with other computational models such as object oriented , declarative ( functional , logic , constraint ) programming or extensions of them with coordination capabilities . * applications ( especially where the industry is involved ) . * theoretical aspects ( semantics , reasoning , verification ) . * software architectures and software engineering techniques . * middleware platforms ( e . g . corba ) . * all aspects related to the modeling of information systems ( groupware , internet and the web , workflow management , cscw ) . track program chair : ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ george a . papadopoulos department of computer science university of cyprus 75 kallipoleos str . , p . o . b . 537 cy-1678 , nicosia , cyprus e - mail : george @ cs . ucy . ac . cy tel : + 357 2 338705 / 06 , fax : + 357 2 339062 guidelines for submission : ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ original papers from the above-mentioned or other related areas will be considered . this includes three categories of submissions : 1 ) original and unpublished research ; 2 ) reports of innovative computing applications in the arts , sciences , engineering , business , government , education and industry ; and 3 ) reports of successful technology transfer to new problem domains . each submitted paper will be fully refereed and undergo a blind review process by at least three referees . the accepted papers in all categories will be published in the acm sac ' 99 proceedings . there will also be a special issue of the journal of programming languages , chapman & hall ( http : / / www . chapmanhall . com / jp / default . html ) with expanded versions of selected papers from those that will be accepted for this special track as regular papers . submission guidelines must be strictly followed : * submit six ( 6 ) copies of original manuscripts to the sac ' 99 coordination models , languages and applications track program chair ( address shown above ) . alternatively , submit your paper electronically in uuencoded compressed postscript format ; this is strongly encouraged . fax submissions will not be accepted . * the author ( s ) name ( s ) and address ( es ) must not appear in the body of the paper , and self-reference should be in the third person . this is to facilitate blind review . * the body of the paper should not exceed 5 , 000 words ( approximately 15 pages , double-spaced ) . * a separate cover sheet ( in the case of electronic submission this should be sent separately from the main paper ) should show the title of the paper , the author ( s ) name ( s ) and affiliation ( s ) , and the address ( including e-mail , telephone , and fax ) to which correspondence should be sent . * all submissions must be received by august 17 , 1998 . anyone wishing to review papers for this special track should contact the track program chair at the address shown above . important dates : ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ * august 17 , 1998 : paper submission . * october 15 , 1998 : author notification . * december 1 , 1998 : camera - ready copy .
