tovena , lucia m . ; the fine structure of polarity sensitivity ; 0-8153 - 3133 - 9 , cloth ; pages , $ 71 ; garland publishing ; outstanding dissertations in linguistics this study investigates the phenomenon of polarity sensitivity , proposing a new perspective which focuses on the behavior and properties of sensitive items and the phrases they form . it rests on the observation that the complexity of the phenomenon requires a more articulated analysis than the standard one based on licensing conditions . the study adopts a broader notion of sensitivity , which extends beyond the traditional one restricted to polarity . it includes other factors which are defined in relation to the semantics of the sensitive items . as a result , the attention is centered on the web of interactions the item entertains with its context of occurrence , rather than on polarity licensing conditions . these items are not lexical black boxes , mutually undistinguishable with respect to polarity licensing . the study shows that the distribution and interpretation of these items follow from constraints related to the properties of their semantic domain . aspect and temporal order are crucial factors for sensitive temporal connectives and adverbials , while referential links and existential import matter for determiners . analogies and differences with other phenomena related to negation , e . g . negative concord , are discussed . the volume also contains an extensive critical overview of research on the topic in the past thirty years . this book will be of interest to scholars in the area of semantics , syntax and their interface . it also points to various important themes in pragmatics and cognitive science , e . g . the role of context and reference , and the notion of interpretation strategies . e - mail : info @ garland . com
