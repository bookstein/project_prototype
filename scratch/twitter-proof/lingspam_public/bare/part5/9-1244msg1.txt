Subject: eurogp ' 99

call for papers eurogp ' 99 second european workshop on genetic programming goteborg , 26-27 may , 1999 genetic programming ( gp ) is a new branch of evolutionary computation in which the structures in the population being evolved are computer programs . gp has been applied successfully to a large number of difficult problems like automatic design , pattern recognition , robotic control , synthesis of neural networks , symbolic regression , music and picture generation , etc . eurogp ' 99 is the biggest event entirely devoted to genetic programming to be held in europe , the second of its kind after eurogp ' 98 which took place this year in paris . the aims are to give european and non - european researchers in the area of genetic programming as well as people from industry an opportunity to present their latest research and discuss current developments and applications . the event will be held at chalmers university of technology in goteborg , sweden . the workshop is sponsored by evonet , the network of excellence in evolutionary computing , and is one of the activities of evogp , the evonet working group on genetic programming . it will be held in conjunction with five other major european events : * evorobot ' 99 , the second european workshop on evolutionary robotics , * evoiasp ' 99 , the first european workshop on evolutionary image analysis and signal processing , * euroectel ' 99 , the first european workshop on evolutionary telecommunications , * evostim ' 99 , the first european workshop on evolutionary sheduling and time-tabling , * evoscondi ' 99 , the first european workshop on evolutionary computation for systems , control and drives industry , topics of interest include , but are not limited to : theoretical developments experimental results on performance and behaviour of gp runs new algorithms , representations and operators novel applications of gp to real-life problems hybrid architectures including gp components comparisons with other machine learning or program-induction techniques new libraries and implementations the workshop will consist of : a tutorial on gp by john koza an invited talk oral and poster sessions with periods for discussion software demos and industrial stands fees : registration fees are still being finalised and will be publicised shortly . registration to eurogp ' 99 will include free non-transferable registration to evorobot ' 99 , evoiasp ' 99 , euroectel ' 99 , evostim ' 99 and evoscondi ' 99 ( and vice versa ) . a reduced registration rate will be available for students . submissions : to submit , send your manuscript ( max length : 10 a4 pages ) to one of the co-chairs , riccardo poli and peter nordin , in postscript ( preferably compressed and uuencoded ) by email ( see addresses below ) not later than december 15 , 1998 . the papers will be peer reviewed by at least two members of the program committee . authors will be notified via email on the results of the review by january 15 , 1999 . the authors of accepted papers will have four weeks to improve their paper on the basis of the reviewers ' comments and will be asked to send a camera ready version of their manuscripts in lncs format ( 12 pages recommended , 15 pages max ) by february 15th , 1999 . the papers accepted will appear in the workshop proceedings , published by springer in the lecture notes in computer science series , which will be available at the workshop . -
