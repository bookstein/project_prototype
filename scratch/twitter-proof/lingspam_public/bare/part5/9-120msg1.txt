Subject: aspects of bilingualism in the ancient world

aspects of bilingualism in the ancient world the university of reading , 2 - 4 april 1998 an international conference on bilingualism organised by prof . j . n . adams ( reading ) , prof . m . e . p . janse ( gent ) and dr s . c . r . swain ( warwick ) will be held at the university of reading from 2 - 4 april 1998 . sixteen invited speakers from britain and abroad will give papers . no attempt will be made to achieve a comprehensive coverage of language contact in the ancient mediterranean world , but the focus will instead be on greek and latin in contact both with each other and with other languages . it is intended that some papers should be linguistic in orientation ( i . e . that they should take account of recent research by linguists on bilingualism in modern societies , relating the findings if possible to issues of ancient bilingualism ) , but it is also obvious that historians and literary scholars commonly address problems related to language contact . we hope that the programme of papers will offer a combination of sociolinguistic , literary , cultural and historical approaches to the subject . conference program thursday , april 2 12 . 00 -
