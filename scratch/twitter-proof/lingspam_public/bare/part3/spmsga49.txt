Subject: help make the world a better place !

dear investor , it 's quite obvious we ' re more powerful in numbers than alone , we can stamp out problems we are faced with day in day out but we make no attempt and if any very little to help irradicate a . i . d . s , famin , the homeless , cancer , child abuse , victims of rape and incest , violence and corruption world wide and do n't forget the environment ( it 's a total disaster ) . panamanian offshore banks require as little as $ 1 000 000 . 00 usd in paid in capital to qualify for bank registration . your $ 1 000 . 00 usd investment or more can lead you to an unlimited return . here 's some mathematical logistics you take 1000 people together each investing $ 1 000 . 00 usd that makes $ 1 000 000 . 00 usd . we go to panama and register for public listing so all our shareholders can each get 1000 shares each at $ 1 . 00 per share , if all goes well and the securities commission accepts the public listing , we go to step 2 . step 2 . we go to the banking commission and apply for a bank license and upon approval , you ' ve got your bank owned by 1000 shareholders each holding 1000 shares and can be traded freely and we can apply for a listing on the panamanian stock exchange or any other exchange therafter . let 's look at the example below to see how power can be in numbers . the minimal interest paid out for example sake is 12 % anually on $ 1 000 000 . 00 that gives a return of is $ 120 000 . 00 usd . now let 's go back to reality if you take $ 1 000 . 00 usd and if your lucky your bank will give you at most a 4 % annual interest rate , that gives you a return of $ 40 . 00 usd . now let 's recap , we have 1000 shareholders who invested $ 1 000 . 00 usd each and at the end of a year each shareholders shares have made a substantial return , the exact return for this example is the return on $ 1 000 000 . 00 usd at 12 % annual interest which is $ 120 000 . 00 usd divided by 1000 shareholders = $ 120 . 00 and each of your shares has just incresed by 0 . 12 , $ 120 . 00 divided by 1000 shares = 0 . 12 cents . you ' ve gained 3 times the return compared to the return your bank would have given you after a year . now this is a very bad example because banks deal with daily currency trades , bankers acceptances , treasury bills , government bonds , gics , stocks , mutual funds , credit and debit / check cards , loans , lines of credit , mortgages and daily transaction fees . but the example above gives you a clear picture that alone you do not have the potential that a mere 1000 people have and with a group you see that your profit potential is much greater because your total capital is much greater and gives you more opportunities and greater flexibility . with banks making record profits of $ 800 000 000 -
