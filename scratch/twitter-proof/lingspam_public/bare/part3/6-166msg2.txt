Subject: re : 6 . 137 ipa

i did n't follow this discussion , but my reaction is : ' altus ' only means its own opposite when translated into english ( or other languages ) . ' altus ' means ) altus ( , full stop . it 's more a property of the sea ( cf . german ' auf hoher see ' ) that it is ' high ' and 'd eep ' at the same time , depending on perspective ; latin choses to use the same expression for both perspectives . hartmut haberland
