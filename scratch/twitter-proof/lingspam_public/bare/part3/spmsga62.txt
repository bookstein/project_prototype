Subject: dated material

please follow the instructions of this letter very carefully , immediately print and read twice . greetings hopefully my name is still on the list below . i am a retired attorney , and about two years ago a man came to me with a letter . the letter he brought me is the same as the letter in front of you now . he asked me to verify the fact that this letter was legal . i told him that i would review it and get back to him . when i first read the letter i thought it was some off-the - wall idea to make money . a week later i met again with my client to discuss the issue . i told him that the letter originally brought to me was not 100 % legal . my client asked me to alter the letter to make it 100 % legal . i advised him to make a small change in the letter and it will be all right . i was curious about the letter , so he told me how it works . i thought it was a long shot , so i decided against participating . before my client left , i asked him to keep me updated as to his results . about two months later he called to tell me that he had received over $ 800 , 000 in cash ! ! i did n't believe him so he asked me to try the plan and see for myself . i thought about it for a few days and decided that there was not much to lose . i followed the instructions exactly and mailed out 200 letters . sure enough the money started coming in ! it came slowly at first , but after three weeks i was getting more than i could open in a day . after about three months the money stopped coming . i kept a precise record of my earnings and at the end it totaled $ 868 , 439 . 00 . i was earning a good living as a lawyer , but as anyone in the legal profession will tell you , there is a lot of stress that comes with the job . i told myself if things worked out i would retire from practice and play golf . i decided to try the letter again , but this time i sent out 500 letters out . well , three months after that i had totaled $ 2 , 344 , 178 . 00 ! i just could n't believe it . i met my old client for lunch to find out how this exactly works . he told me that there were a few similar letters going around . what made this one different is the fact that there are seven names on the letter , not five like most others . that fact alone resulted in more returns . the other factor was the advice i gave him in making sure the whole thing was perfectly legal , since no one wants to risk doing anything illegal . i bet now you are curious about what little changes i told him to make . well , if you send a letter like this out , to be legal , you must sell something if you expect to receive a dollar . i told him that anyone sending a dollar out must receive something in return . so when you send a dollar to each of the seven names on the list , you must include a slip of paper saying " please put me on your mailing list " and include your name , mailing address and e-mail address ( your phone # is optional ) . this is the key to the program ! the item you will receive for your dollar you send to the seven names below , is this letter and the right to earn thousands . we will be working together to improve each other 's lives ! follow the simple instructions below exactly , and in less than three months you will receive over $ 800 , 000 . 00 guaranteed ! ! ! ! a ) immediately send $ 1 . 00 to each of the seven people listed below . wrap the dollar in a note ( type or handwritten ) saying " please add me to your mailing list " and include your name , mailing address , and e-mail address . your phone number is optional . 1 - jal 8401 e . 60th st . # 2811 tulsa , ok 74145-5075 2 - lbm enterprises 167 hamilton st . oceanside , ca 92054 3 - s + k industries 641a puller pl san clemente , ca 92672 4 - smooth enterprises 205-38 abeyta ct , oceanside , ca 92054 5 - d&k cybermart 2281 annadale way , chula vista ca 91915 6 - arawak , 2442 n . main st . , suite 185 , gainesville , fl 32609 7 - mike m , p . o . box 89009 cp elysee , laval , quebec , h7w 5k1 b ) remove the name next to # 1 at the top of the list and move the rest of the names up on position . then place your name in the # 7 spot . this is best done by saving this to a file and enter in your information on line # 7 . be very careful when you type the addresses and proof read them . c ) when you have completed the above instructions you have options of mailing your new letter in two ways 1 ) through us postal service or 2 ) through e-mail . this letter has been proven perfectly legal for both ways as long as you follow the above instructions , because you ' re purchasing membership in our exclusive mailing list . to mail this out over the internet , you could browse through areas and find people to send this to all the time . all you have to do is cut and paste e-mail addresses wherever you are on the internet . remember , it does n't cost anything to mail on the internet . or you can use a mass e-mail network to mail it out in large volumes for you . we highly recommend this one . they always e-mail more than the amount you purchase and their addresses are fresh . e - mail this letter to them with your name and address in position # 7 above . bulk email is highly recommended for ease and efficiency . newsgroups tend to be very unreliable . just do a search on the web for bulk email . * * you will want to e-mail this to as many people as you can . this will bring you big payoffs . this company has been most effective for this program . * * * keep in mind that there is no limit to the amount of names you could send out . the more names you send the more money you will make . we strongly encourage you to mail this letter to family and friends and relatives as well . * * * this is a service and is 100 % legal ! ! ! ( refer to title 18 , section 1302 & 1342 of the u . s . postal and lottery laws ) assume for example you get a 7 . 5 % return rate , which is very conservative . my first attempt was about 9 . 5 % and my second time was over 11 % 1 ) when you mail out 200 letters , 15 people will send you $ 1 . 00 2 ) those 15 people mail out 200 letters and 225 people send you $ 1 . 00 3 ) those 225 people mail out 200 letters and 3 , 375 people send you $ 1 . 00 4 ) those 3 , 375 people mail out 200 letters and 50 , 625 people send you $ 1 . 00 5 ) those 50 , 625 people mail out 200 letters and 759 , 375 people send you $ 1 . 00 6 ) those 759 , 375 people mail out 200 letter and 11 , 390 , 625 people send you $ 1 . 00 at this point your name drops off the list . think about it . with only the first six levels you have received over $ 813 , 615 . 00 ! it works every time , but how well depends on how many letters you send out . in the example above you mailed out 200 letters , if you mailed out 500 letters , you would have received over $ 2 , 006 , 917 . 00 check the math yourself , i want you to , but i guarantee it is correct ! with this kind of return , you ' ve got to try it . try it once and you will do it again - guaranteed ! just make sure you send a dollar to each of the seven names on the list with a note to be added to their mailing list . together we will all prosper ! ! ! ps you ' ve read this far , so let me ask you one simple question . q - what have you got to lose a - only $ 7 . 00 what you can gain is an income , like the example in the letter . very small risk . very small expense , huge potential returns ! what do you have to lose ? i invite you to join our mailing list today ! wishing you happy success ! p . p . s . we have a 95 % return at this point ! ! !
