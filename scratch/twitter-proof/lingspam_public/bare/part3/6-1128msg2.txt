Subject: re : kinship terms

fwiw , i believe i ' ve heard " bro " in hawai ' ian pidgin in the early ' 70s . i would assume it has an independent origin there . it seemed like to be primarily used to refer to those of one 's own racial / ethnic group ( not necessarily kin ) , but could be extended to include even haoles ( like me ) .
