Subject: language maintenance and loss

third international conference on maintenance and loss of minority languages koningshof conference center , veldhoven , the netherlands november 26 - november 27 , 1998 call for papers and registration introduction in line with the two previous international conferences on maintenance and loss of minority languages ( noordwijkerhout , the netherlands ; 1988 and 1992 ) , the aim of this conference is to bring together recent developments from various disciplines . the ambition of this third conference is to offer a major contribution to a theoretical discussion on the determinants of language shift and language loss , supported by the exchange of new research data . while the two preceding conferences concentrated mainly on the questions ` what is lost of the language ? ' ( structural-linguistic aspects ) and ` why does shift occur ? ' ( sociological and social-psychological explanatory factors ) , the veldhoven conference will focus on two questions ; ` why does shift occur ? ' and ` how is a language lost ? ' , i . e . , what are the psycholinguistic processes involved in language loss ? emphasis will be on the interaction between the process of transferring from the first to the second language and the gradual decline of skills in the first language , at the individual and group levels . the conference takes place on two consecutive days . plenary speakers are invited to make inspiring and thought-provoking remarks on the two conference themes outlined above , as well as on the broader theoretical framework . together with the contributions of the free paper presenters , the interaction between plenary speakers and participants forms the input for workshops and a round table discussion on the development of an integrated theoretical framework . this framework can then serve as a renewed starting point for continued research into language shift and loss in the new millennium . the organizing committee is also open to contributions from disciplines that have recently entered or touched upon the field and may shed a new light on the language change processes involved . the organizing committee will determine the best manner in which the results of the conference can be published . programme the conference will consist of three sections . the first section addresses the sociological and social-psychological explanatory context in which language shift processes take place . the second section deals with language attrition from a psycholinguistic perspective , and the third is fully devoted to the building of an integrated explanatory framework for processes of language shift and loss . in memory of willem fase , one of the initiators of the first and second conference on maintenance and loss of minority languages , who died in 1997 , a new forum called the willem fase lecture has been set up . this plenary lecture forum will be granted to a promising scholar , to be selected from the abstracts submitted . thursday , november 26 , 1998 section i : language shift from a sociological and social-psychological perspective 08 . 30-09 . 30 registration at koningshof conference center , veldhoven , the netherlands tea / coffee 09 . 30-10 . 00 conference opening 10 . 00-11 . 00 plenary session : lesley milroy 11 . 00-12 . 00 plenary session : richard bourhis 12 . 00-13 . 00 lunch 13 . 00-13 . 45 parallel sessions of free papers 13 . 45-14 . 30 parallel sessions 14 . 30-15 . 15 parallel sessions 15 . 15-15 . 30 closing session of section i 15 . 30-16 . 00 tea / coffee section ii : language loss from a psycholinguistic perspective 16 . 00-17 . 00 plenary session : kees de bot 17 . 00-17 . 45 parallel sessions 17 . 45-18 . 30 parallel sessions 19 . 00-20 . 30 dinner friday , november 27 , 1998 section ii continued : language loss from a psycholinguistic perspective 08 . 30-09 . 30 plenary session : joel walters 09 . 30-10 . 15 parallel sessions 10 . 15-10 . 30 closing session of section ii 10 . 30-11 . 00 tea / coffee 11 . 00-12 . 00 plenary session : willem fase lecture 12 . 00-13 . 00 lunch section iii : towards an integrated explanatory framework for processes of language shift and loss 13 . 00-15 . 00 preparatory workshops 15 . 00-15 . 30 tea / coffee 15 . 30-17 . 00 round table chaired by michael clyne 17 . 00-17 . 30 closing session of conference general information conference secretariat tilburg university research group on language and minorities c / o heleen strating -
