Subject: re : syldavian tutorial

jacques guy 's grammar of syldavian is of course a very welcome contribution to the understanding of that seldom investigated language . however , one could n't help being slightly disappointed that it did not contain a translation of the longest text ( and only one , as far as i know ) which has survived in this ancient language . i refer of course to the page of the 14th cent . manuscript which is reproduced in " le sceptre d ' ottokar " ( p . 21 ) , and which goes approximately thus : pir ottokar du ~ s pollsz ez ko " nikstz dan tronn eszt pho ma ~ ozeilla ~ cza " ida ~ o " n estca ~ r akpu ~ kzommetz pakkeh o lapza ~ da ko " nikstz itd o alpu ~ klo " ppz staszrvitchz erom szu ~ bel o " . da ~ zsbick ta " llta o " pp o ca ~ rro " . can we have a chapter 2 ? guy deutscher
