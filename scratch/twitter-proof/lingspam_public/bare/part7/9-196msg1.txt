Subject: 2nd cfp : ijhcs special issue

call for papers the international journal of human - computer studies will publish a special issue on the theme collaboration , cooperation and conflict in dialogue systems = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = this special issue is devoted to theoretical and empirical studies of cooperation and collaboration in dialogue systems , addressing problems specific to dialogue management . it is associated with the workshop on the same theme held at ijcai-97 in nagoya but seeks submissions from all researchers who have been working on the topic , not just the workshop participants . work on autonomous cooperative systems has shown the importance of collaboration in different domains : besides collaborating with users to provide requested information and to solve their problems , the systems should also be able to collaborate with other specialist intelligent systems ( as in multi-agent infrastructures , for example ) . also , research in natural language dialogue has brought new insights about collaboration : how mutual belief is established in dialogue ( and , consequently , task ) fulfillment , as well as how to cooperate to enable successful communication between the conversants . the notions of cooperation and collaboration are closely related to each other , but likely not the same : cooperation is one of the design principles for dialogue systems , but such systems do not necessarily collaborate with the user . to what degree is cooperation necessary for collaboration and how does it appear in dialogue ? cooperation turns into benevolence if the agent attempts to fulfill the partner 's goals without questioning their contextual relevance , but this is not necessarily collaboration . on the other hand , if the agents pursue their own goals without considering those of their partners or the joint task , their actions can hardly be described as cooperative or collaborative . this special issue concentrates on human-human and human-computer communication , and on the ways cooperation and collaboration are manifested in these situations : how the partners jointly construct dialogue acts , infer non-explicitly expressed intentions , negotiate appropriate references , generate cooperative answers , co-produce utterances , give feedback , help each other in task achievement , etc . since collaboration and cooperation are also related to conflict situations , arising from misunderstandings , erroneous perception , partial knowledge , false beliefs , etc . , submissions that examine how cooperation and collaboration work in solving conflicts , and how the partners negotiate to reach a mutually acceptable resolution are also welcome . we encourage submissions on different aspects of cooperation and collaboration , addressing especially one or more of the following research issues : - how can we define " collaborative dialogues " ? are all dialogues collaborative ? how do corpus studies back up the classification ? - what kind of individual commitments are needed for collaboration ? how do social settings ( roles , acquaintance ) affect communication and collaboration ? how are these commitments and settings represented in a dialogue model ? - what is the role of cooperation in collaborative dialogue ? can collaborative activity include benevolent or uncooperative behaviour ? does collaboration require sincerity ( e . g . , can cheating be collaborative ) ? - how does collaboration contribute to conflict resolution and recovery from misunderstandings ? how can costs and benefits of collaboration be measured ? - how is collaboration and cooperation related to task performance ? what mechanisms are needed to combine collaborative task plans with dialogue contributions ? - how can cooperation / collaboration principles and mechanisms be expressed in formal , computational models of communication or interaction ? how can these models be implemented ? - is collaboration the main issue to problems in dialogue management ? what are the solutions , future research problems ? both theoretical and more practically oriented papers are welcome , but we encourage papers that provide real-world examples of collaboration , cooperation and conflict , and compare multiple ways of addressing the problems that arise . submission of papers full paper submissions to the special issue should be in the ijhcs format . information for the ijhcs authors can be found at : http : / / ksi . cpsc . ucalgary . ca / ijhcs / ijhcs _ ia . html to help to coordinate the review process , authors who intend to submit are asked to send a short statement of intention to submit to david sadek one month prior the deadline . the deadline for submissions is march 16 . submissions should preferably be sent as postscript files by email to : david . sadek @ cnet . francetelecom . fr if this is not possible , send six ( 6 ) hardcopies to david sadek at the address : david sadek france telecom cnet - dih technopole anticipa - 2 , avenue pierre marzin 22307 lannion cedex - france in either case , the authors should also send a separate electronic title and abstract page ( in plain text format ) to david . sadek @ cnet . francetelecom . fr the submissions will undergo the usual ijhcs reviewing process taking into account the requirements of the special issue . each paper will be reviewed by 3 reviewers who are members of the scientific board . authors of submitted papers will also be asked to act as referees for other submissions . the reviewers will judge the submissions primarily along the following dimensions : relevance , significance , originality , clarity , technical soundness , and overall quality of presentation . important dates november 1997 call for papers february 16 statement of intent to submit march 16 submission deadline june 15 notification of acceptance august 15 final papers due special issue editors : kristiina jokinen atr , japan kjokinen @ itl . atr . co . jp david sadek france telecom , cnet , france david . sadek @ cnet . francetelecom . fr david r . traum university of maryland , usa traum @ cs . umd . edu special issue scientific board : james allen , university of rochester , usa jens allwood , university of g \ " { o } teborg , sweden michael baker , university lyon ii , france jennifer chu - carroll , bell laboratories , usa patrick healey , atr , japan graeme hirst , university of toronto , canada masato ishizaki , ntt , japan karen lochbaum , us west , usa susan mcroy , university of wisconsin - milwaukee , usa david novick , eurisco , france candace sidner , lotus development corporation , usa more information : updated information on the special issue as well as the ijcai workshop is available at : http : / / www . cs . umd . edu / ~ traum / cccinds / general information on ijhcs is available at : http : / / ksi . cpsc . ucalgary . ca / ijhcs
