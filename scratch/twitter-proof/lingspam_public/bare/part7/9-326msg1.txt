o what are sound methodologies for relating discourse relations with potential realizations ? o are there discourse relations that are always lexically signalled ? are there any that are never lexically signalled ? o what non-lexical ( i . e . , syntactic or prosodic ) means are used to signal a relation ? o in production , how does one decide whether to signal a relation at all ? o in production , how does one motivate a choice among candidate signals for a given relation ? o in production , how does the choice of signal interact with other decisions ( in particular , those of linearizing some tree or graph structure ) ? o in analysis , is it possible to reliably infer discourse relations from surface cues ? o in analysis , how can one disambiguate polysemous signals such as " and " , " since " ( temporal or causal ) etc . ? o what are useful lexical representations of discourse markers , for both analysis and production ? o what are useful representations of discourse relations ( and the entities they relate ) , such that they facilitate the realization decision ? what features would one like to have handy in a representation so that choices can be made easily ? o are there significant differences between realizations in spoken and written language ? o how do individual languages differ in terms of any of the above issues ? organizing committee the workshop is organized by manfred stede ( tu berlin ) leo wanner ( university of stuttgart ) eduard hovy ( isi / usc , marina del rey ) requirements for submission papers are invited that address any of the topics listed above . maximum length is 8 pages including figures and references . please use a4 or us letter format and set margins so that the text lies within a rectangle of 6 . 5 x 9 inches ( 16 . 5 x 23 cm ) . use classical fonts such as times roman or computer modern , 11 to 12 points for text , 14 to 16 points for headings and title . latex users are encouraged to use the style file provided by acl : http : / / coling-acl 98 . iro . umontreal . ca / colaclsub . sty papers can be submitted either electronically in postscript format , or as hardcopies . submissions from north america should be sent to : eduard hovy information sciences institute 4676 admiralty way marina del rey , ca 90292-6695 u . s . a . hovy @ isi . edu submissions from elsewhere should be sent to either of the following : manfred stede leo wanner tu berlin computer science department kit project group intelligent systems group sekr . fr 6-10 university of stuttgart franklinstr . 28 / 29 breitwiesenstr . 20-22 d-10587 berlin d-70565 stuttgart germany germany stede @ cs . tu-berlin . de wannerlo @ informatik . uni-stuttgart . de timetable deadline for electronic submissions : march 10 , 1998 deadline for hardcopy submissions : march 13 ( arrival date ) notification of acceptance : may 1 , 1998 final manuscripts due : june 12 , 1998 program committee sandra carberry ( u delaware ) barbara dieugenio ( u pittsburgh ) eduard hovy ( usc / isi ) alistair knott ( u edinburgh ) alex lascarides ( u edinburgh ) owen rambow ( cogentex inc . ) ted sanders ( u utrecht ) donia scott ( u brighton ) wilbert spooren ( u tilburg ) manfred stede ( tu berlin ) keith vander linden ( calvin college ) marilyn walker ( att labs ) leo wanner ( u stuttgart ) * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * call for papers call for papers call for papers acl / coling-98 workshop on partially automated techniques for transcribing naturally occurring , continuous speech august 16 , 1998 ( following acl / coling-98 ) university of montreal , montreal ( quebec , canada ) call for papers description - - - - - - - - - - the development of robust systems for speech analysis and synthesis depends crucially on the availability of well-annotated corpora of naturally occurring , continuous speech . yet existing speech corpora are rarely well-annotated . a key to proper annotation is the availability of partially automated systems for linking selected portions of a visual display of speech to the corresponding transcriptions . to be of practical use , such systems must be able to handle large files of digitized speech and they should permit transcriptions at different levels of analysis . this workshop will be devoted to the presentation and discussion of papers and software demonstrations which reflect the current state of the art . we invite proposals of up to 800 words which address the development , use , evaluation , or potential commercial application of such systems . submissions - - - - - - - - - - only email submissions in latex or ascii will be accepted . authors should submit an abstract of no more than 800 words to : trans98 @ cs . concordia . ca style files and templates for latex submissions can be found at http : / / colingacl98 . iro . umontreal . ca / styles . html the official language of the conference is english . important deadlines - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - submission deadline : april 15 , 1998 notification date : may 15 , 1998 camera ready copy due : june 15 , 1998 program committee - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - nancy belmore concordia university , canada sabine bergler concordia university , canada john esling univ . of victoria , canada eric keller univ . of lausanne , switzerland roland kuhn panasonic technologies , inc . , u . s . a . douglas o'shaughnessy inrs - telecommunications , canada ching y . suen concordia university , canada organizers - - - - - - - - - nancy belmore concordia university , canada sabine bergler concordia university , canada douglas o'shaughnessy inrs - telecommunications , canada registration - - - - - - - - - - - there is a discounted workshop fee for participants of coling / acl . participants who are not registered for coling / acl will have to pay the full workshop fee ( to be announced shortly ) . information - - - - - - - - - - any requests for information should be sent to trans98 @ cs . concordia . ca
