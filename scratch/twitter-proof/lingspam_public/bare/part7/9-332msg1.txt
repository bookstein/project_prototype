Subject: effects of morphological case - - utrecht univ

second call for papers effects of morphological case workshop to be held at the utrecht institute of linguistics ots , utrecht university , 28-29 august 1998 . organizers : helen de hoop , olaf koeneman , iris mulders , and fred weerman invited speakers : paul kiparsky , joan maling , alec marantz the aim of this workshop is to investigate the effects of morphological case that go beyond its mere phonological characteristics . in the gb model of the eighties , morphological case was considered a spell-out of abstract case . while abstract case is present in all languages , the spell-out is only in a subset . in such a view , the presence of morphological case may help to uncover more abstract features , but in itself it does not have syntactic or semantic effects . this runs counter to observations that the presence / absence of morphological case correlates with the presence / absence of certain syntactic and semantic properties . a case in point is the more or less classical observation that the presence of morphological case is related to the possibility for several types of scrambling . other approaches have been proposed to incorporate ( some of ) these effects of morphological case and the idea that parametric differences should be reducable to morphological properties has been defended with varying success . against this background , the present workshop seeks answers for questions like the following : what is the relation between morphological case and abstract case ? what are the distributional , interpretive and phonological effects of the presence of morphological case ? the aim of this workshop is to bring together theoretical and empirical considerations on the effects of morphological case . issues for discussion involve the implications of morphological case for abstract case theory , the difference between structural and inherent case , agreement , word order phenomena , grammaticalization processes , discourse theory , and semantics . we welcome contributions relating to all aspects of linguistics . in particular we are interested in comparative , diachronic and acquisitional evidence that shows that relations between morphological case and other aspects of the grammar do ( not ) exist . the program will include three invited lectures of experts on the topic of morphological case . the provisional titles are as follows : paul kiparsky ( stanford ) : ` cases as complementizers ' joan maling ( brandeis ) : ` morphological case is not ( always ) to blame ! ' alec marantz ( mit ) : ` in defense of " spell-out " : why morphological case should indeed have only an indirect reflective relation to the syntax ' the workshop has room for 13 selected talks of 35 minutes . authors should submit 5 copies of an anonymous abstract of no more than 2 pages , one camera-ready copy indicating the author 's name and a 3x5 " card with the author 's name , address , affiliation , e-mail address , phone number , and the title of the paper . we hope to be able to ( partially ) reimburse all speakers . please send your abstracts to : workshop on morphological case utrecht institute of linguistics ots trans 10 3512 jk utrecht the netherlands the deadline for submission is april 1 , 1998 . authors will be notified of acceptance by may 15 . * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * olaf koeneman * * utrecht institute of linguistics ots * * trans 10 ( room 2 . 20 ) , 3512 jk utrecht * * tel . + 31 30 253 8304 * * email : koeneman @ let . ruu . nl * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *
