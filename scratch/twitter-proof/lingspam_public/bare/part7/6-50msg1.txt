Subject: reduplicative constructions and polarity

moravscik ( in greenberg 's language universals ) notes that reduplicative constructions that do not fulfill a purely grammatical function usually intensifies the base morpheme . sometimes , though , it may actually have the exact opposite function : it de-intensifies the base morpheme . i am interested in the connection between this process and the process by which the literal message of a sarcastic utterance assumes the exact opposite meaning by means of a conceptually similar feature : exaggeration ( of , say , amplitude , duration , pitch , or clarity ) . does anyone know of any further research on this particular phenomenon ? any speculations ? perhaps there is an intimate connection here with the polarity-based cognitive mapping givon ( in negation in language : pragmatics , function , ontology ) proposed ? sincerely , anders lars anders joensson macalester college email : ljonsson @ macalstr . edu
