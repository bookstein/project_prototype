acl ' 98 workshop " the computational treatment of nominals " august 16 , 1998 universite de montreal montreal / canada http : / / www . cs . brandeis . edu / ~ federica / workshops / coling / call . html this workshop aims at bringing together researchers who are interested in the study of the computational properties of nominals and noun phrases . the focus is on representational questions as they relate directly to nlp requirements and applications . understanding the properties of the nominal system is extremely important since nouns and nominalizations are used extensively by both people and systems : searching and communicating with either a telegraphic or a more expressive language involves heavy use of nominal forms . a number of nlp applications , ranging from " intelligent " key-word search to text summarization and information extraction , among others , not only require some way of recognizing nominal forms , but also require at least a shallow understanding of the semantic information that nouns carry . it is therefore of great interest to consider what impact representing semantic knowledge at a finer level of granularity would have towards enhancing a system 's performance . submissions are invited on one or more of the following topics : * representation of nominals : o design of noun ontologies for use in lexical semantics and machine translation o ambiguity , polysemy , vagueness , and underspecification in the semantics of nominals o identifying the minimal requirements for lexical representations * representational issues in the acquisition of knowledge : o from corpora o from mrds o syntactic and morphological bootstrapping o semantic boostrapping ( role of prepositions , arguments , etc . ) * role of representations for the interpretation of nominals : o techniques for recovering implicit information in nominals o interpretation and generation of nominals in descriptions of events and abstract objects in discourse o recovering implicit semantic relations in nominal compounds o defining implicit semantic relations between nominalizations and the forms they are derived from organizing committee federica busa ( brandeis university ) inderjeet mani ( the mitre corporation ) patrick saint dizier ( irit , universite paul sabatier ) submission information * papers are invited that address any of the topics listed above . * maximum length is 8 pages ( single-spaced ) including figures and references . * please use a4 or us letter format and set margins so that the text lies within a rectangle of 6 . 5 x 9 inches ( 16 . 5 x 23 cm ) . * use classical fonts such as times roman or computer modern , 11 to 12 points for text , 14 to 16 points for headings and title . * latex users are encouraged to use the style file provided by coling-acl ' 98 : http : / / coling-acl 98 . iro . umontreal . ca / colaclsub . sty * authors should send 5 copies in either electronic ( postscript or latex ) or hard-copy format to : federica busa computer science department volen center for complex systems brandeis university waltham , massachusetts 02254 u . s . a . federica @ cs . brandeis . edu criteria for selection will include clarity , originality , relevance , and significance of results . important deadlines * deadline for submission : march 15th , 1998 * notification of authors : may 1st , 1998 * final versions due : june 1 , 1998 program committee * federica busa ( brandeis university ) * jean mark gawron ( sri international ) * bob ingria ( psyche systems corporation ) * beth levin ( northwestern university ) * inderjeet mani ( the mitre corporation ) * paul portner ( georgetown university ) * james pustejovsky ( brandeis university ) * patrick saint dizier ( irit , universit = c8 paul sabatier ) * antonio sanfilippo ( sharp laboratories of europe ) * evelyne viegas ( crl , new mexico state university ) * piek vossen ( university of amsterdam ) -

acl ' 98 workshop = = " usage of wordnet in natural language processing systems " august 16 , 1998 universite de montreal montreal , canada lexicons are indispensable resources for almost every natural language project . to date , wordnet 1 . 5 represents the largest publicly available on-line lexical resource , already used in various applications of the human language technology . systems performing word sense disambiguation , information extraction or retrieval , prepositional attachment , interpretation of nominalizations , textual summarization , coreference resolution , abductive reasoning conversational implicature , recognition of textual cohesion and coherence , intelligent internet searches and some of the digital libraries projects use wordnet . this workshop intends to bring together researchers that use wordnet in different systems and to focus on two particular issues : ( a ) how to customize the knowledge derived from wordnet for various nlp applications and ( b ) how to derive methods that infer semantic information using wordnet . the contributions might address one or more of the following questions : * what are the nlp applications for which wordnet is a valuable resource and how much effort was involved to integrate it in your systems ? * is wordnet used to build ad-hoc ontologies ? what are the applications that use wordnet - derived ontologies ? * how can wordnet be used to develop a word sense disambiguation algorithm of high performance ? * how to extend wordnet for identifying thematic roles and resolving verb polysemy ? * what minimal customization should be implemented to use wordnet for a large-scale abductive reasoning system ? * is wordnet a lexical knowledge base that can be easily used to adjust information extraction systems across domains ? * are the lexico-semantic relations from wordnet a valid base for developing an extended coreference task for information extraction , and what are the possible methodologies ? * how can wordnet be mined to find textual implied information and what is the degree of plausibility of the returned information ? * what are the approaches of using the extensive linguistic knowledge of wordnet to derive the discourse structure of a text ; can it be the only knowledge source and if not , what additional knowledge may be used ? * what is the current performance boost provided by wordnet in the systems using it ? could your systems perform without wordnet ? * what are the desirable features of wordnet for your system , and what would be the predicted performance increase when having them ? _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ organizing committee the workshop is organized by sanda harabagiu ( sri international ) joyce yue chai ( duke university ) _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ home page : http : / / www . ai . sri . com / ~ harabagi / link _ paper / chpt / acl _ work . html _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ requirements for submission papers are invited that address any of the topics listed above . maximum length is 8 pages including figures and references . please use a4 or us letter format and set margins so that the text lies within a rectangle of 6 . 5 x 9 inches ( 16 . 5 x 23 cm ) . use classical fonts such as times roman or computer modern , 11 to 12 points for text , 14 to 16 points for headings and title . latex users are encouraged to use the style file provided by acl : http : / / coling-acl 98 . iro . umontreal . ca / colaclsub . sty papers can be submitted either electronically in postscript format , or as hardcopies . submissions should be sent to : sanda harabagiu sri international 333 ravenswood ave menlo park , ca 94025 u . s . a .
