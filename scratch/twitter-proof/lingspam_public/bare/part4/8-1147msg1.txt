trento , italy > > first announcement and call for papers < < abstracts due : november 10 , 1997 acceptance notification : december 20 , 1997 camera ready paper due : april 30 , 1998 please show interest in contributing to prolamat ' 98 using attached form by : september 30 , 1997 the conference scope of prolamat ' 98 expands design and manifacturing issues to include teams and virtual enterprises which come together across space and time to develop new products and bring them to global markets . manufacturing issues and information models have long been part of concurrent engineering ; they are increasingly important in new product innovation and in the development of manufacturing plans and processes which span multiple companies along with multiple time zones . past emphasis on human aspects and innovation provides a strong foundation for the next prolamat , which emphasizes three themes in separate tracks of the conference : track 1 : sharing experience gained from telecommunication use in industry for agility and innovation track 2 : human and machine communications , modelling , standard representations , reuse track 3 : telecommunication and agility impact on software technology for discrete manufacturing background - - - - - - - - - the prolamat conference is an internationally well known event for demonstrating and evaluating activities and progress in the field of discrete manufacturing . sponsored by the international federation for information processing ( ifip ) , the prolamat is traditionally held every three years and it includes the whole area of advanced software technology for design and manufacturing in discrete manufacturing . past conferences have explored : - manufacturing technology , - advances in cad / cam , - software for discrete manufacturing , - software for manufacturing . the eight international prolamat focused on the theme of man in cim . the 1995 prolamat featured the theme of life cycle modelling for innovative products and processes . the 1998 conference in italy will be organized by the university of trento , school of engineeering and department of computer and managemet sciences , jointly with istituto trentino di cultura , under the auspices of the wg2 for " computer - aided design " and wg3 for " computer - aided manufacturing " of the technical committee 5 for " computer applications in technology " . this conference will be the last prolamat before the next century , and it provides an opportunity to investigate and imagine what the digital communications revolution going on all around us will mean for manufacturing . _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ conference subjects -

case studies and descriptions of experience with emerging technologies for : - concurrent engineering involving shared product and process models , - applications of telecommunications for agility , innovation or virtual organizations , - distributed business process reengineering and out sourcing , - managing virtual teams and developing and sustaining virtual organizations , - advances in telecommunication technology for collaborative knowledge processing for engineering - tele-presence , remote sensing , and distributed coordination of processes , - collaborative feature modelling , feature-based design , and geometric modelling - integration of emerging technologies and tools into existing product development - collaborative version management and update sharing - tools for enterprise integration and managing organizational change - enterprise-wide distribution and coordination of emerging product models . _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ track 2 : human and machine communications , modelling , standard - - - - - - - representations , reuse people , not machines , design new products and make manufacturing systems work . increasingly , groups of people are required to design new products and bring them to market . requirements for agility and the suitability of specific manufacturing processes must be matched with the culture and knowledge base of the work force . world - class processes have floundered when this was not done . information and communication systems can either amplify or reduce the magnitude of differences across culture or engineering discipline . researchers specializing in knowledge representation , modelling , communications , standardization , and reuse will be invited to share their experiences and research perspectives . - enterprise data sharing across engineering , cultural , and supply chain boundaries , - distributed manufacturing and supply chain management - early stage product development which dynamically incorporates supplier constraints - standard models for component information representation , product and process interchange , - technologies for knowledge sharing , collaboration , and across the product lifecycle , - adaptive systems for organizational management , knowledge sharing , education , and training - organizational and manufacturing process simulation - organizing and representing design and manufacturing process for dissemination and reuse - the interface between human and machine for information sharing , training , education , - virtual reality and multi-media in manufacturing and design - collaborative manufacturing process definition and operation - collaborative product and process modeling for the product life cycle - implications of models of human communication for the support of integrated manufacturing _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ track 3 : telecommunication and agility impact on software technology for - - - - - - - discrete manufacturing even in today 's post-industrial information-society , machines , not people , ultimately make the products which humans have designed and will use . digital telecommunication has become an enabling technology for agile organizations and an important tool driving some enterprise innovation . what are the implications of these profound changes in communications technology for discrete manufacturing ? which old assumptions must be rethought , and what totally new opportunities now exist ? how have software tools for discrete manufacturing evolved during these past three years ? the conference , as a whole , and this track , in particular , will attempt to answer these far reaching questions . - rapid and virtual prototyping using distributed teams or distributed manufacturing , - concurrent and simultaneous engineering systems - distributed and global methodologies for design and collaborative manufacturing - intelligent tools which communicate across the shop floor or across institutional boundaries for - automated machining operations , - scheduling , coordination , or planning for machining or manufacturing processes , - architectures , frameworks , and dss for design and integrated manufacturing , - formal design theories and methodologies - engineering simulation , product and process modelling , planning , and scheduling - issues and systems relating to sustainable manufacturing - methods and tools for sustainable product development and manufacturing processes _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ conference chair : g . jacucci invited members to the international program committee l . alting ( dk ) s . ansaldi ( i ) a . baskin ( usa ) p . bertok ( aus ) s . bhattacharyya ( uk ) o . biorke ( n ) k . bo ( n ) m . boari ( i ) g . bracchi ( i ) d . brown ( usa ) l . camarinha -
