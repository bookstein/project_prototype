Subject: software for an experimental mt system

hi subscribers of linguist list , information and software of the experimental mt system of the project kit-fast from the technical university of berlin is now available via www and ftp . the information below is available via www : http : / / www . cs . tu-berlin . de / ~ ww / mtsystem . html this www document contains all hypertext links , which are relevant in order to get the software , documentation and further information . the experimental mt system is implemented in prolog and running on at compatible pc as well as sun workstations ( see below ) . the experimental mt system of the project kit-fast = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = an experimental mt system has been developed and implemented by the project fast within the project group kit . the transfer-based experimental mt system translates german texts into english sentence by sentence . the translation of a sentence consists of morphological , syntactical , semantical and conceptual analysis , transfer , generation and morphological synthesis . the semantic and conceptual analysis , the transfer as well as the generation is realized by one algorithm on the basis of term-rewriting ( known from the automatic provement of equations ) . a module for the evaluation of anaphoric relations of the source language and the kl-one based knowledge representation system back are components of the mt system . the back system is used for the representation of background knowledge in its tbox and of the text content in its abox . the evaluation algorithm uses the representation of the text content in order to check the semantic consistency of possible antecedents for anaphoric pronouns . this factor and others are defined as parameters for the evaluation algorithm . the components of the mt system + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + o morphological analyser based on the sutra system o gpsg parser for direct interpretation of id rules , lp statements and metarules o term-rewrite rule interpreter for semantic and conceptual analysis , transfer and generation o morphological synthesizer based on the sutra system o module for the evaluation of anaphoric relations o the knowledge representation system back o tools for the development of lexicons , grammars and term-rewrite systems linguistic data + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + linguistic data was developed in order to translate a german text , which is " the proposal of the european commission for the esprit programme " . about 100 sentences were successfully tested with the help of the mt system . the linguistic data comprises : o a german grammar ( gpsg ) : - 22 main categories , 34 features - 22 aliases - 76 id rules - 23 lp statements - 5 metarules - 23 fcrs - 265 lexical entries ( stem forms ) o 134 term-rewrite rules for semantic analysis ( german ) o 37 term-rewrite rules for conceptual analysis ( german ) o 248 term-rewrite rules for transfer ( german - - ) english ) o 182 term-rewrite rules for generation ( english ) o 8 factors for the evaluation of anaphoric relations in german : 1 . agreement 2 . binding 3 . proximity 4 . preference for the semantic subject 5 . topic preference 6 . identity of roles 7 . negative preference for free adjuncts 8 . conceptual consistency o the predefined background knowledge comprises selectional restrictions implementation + + + + + + + + + + + + + + the mt system is implemented in quintus - prolog 3 . 1 ( commercial software ) and swi - prolog 1 . 9 . 5 ( public domain software ) . both prolog dialects are running on sun workstations under sunos and at compatible pcs under dos ( windows 3 . 1 ) . the mt system is tested for quintus - and swi - prolog under sunos and under swi - prolog under windows 3 . 1 and needs about 10 mb of hard disk space . in order to get the software for the mt system running on at compatible pcs under dos ( windows 3 . 1 ) see http : / / www . cs . tu-berlin . de / ~ ww / mtdos . html . if you are interested in receiving the software for the mt system for sun workstations under sunos see http : / / www . cs . tu-berlin . de / ~ ww / mtsun . html . documents related to the mt system + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + o birte schmitz , susanne preu _ , christa hauenschild " textreprdsentation und hintergrundwissen f | r die anaphernresolution im maschinellen \ bersetzungssystem kit-fast " kit -
