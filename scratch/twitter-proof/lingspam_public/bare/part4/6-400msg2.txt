Subject: open / closed word classes , etc .

can anyone help with this question ? many introductory ( and some other ) books on linguistics mention the open / closed distinction for word classes and the lexical / grammatical meaning distinction . none that i have seen , however , say anything about who invented these distinctions , when , where , and why . does anyone have any information about the provenance of these distinctions ? thanks .
