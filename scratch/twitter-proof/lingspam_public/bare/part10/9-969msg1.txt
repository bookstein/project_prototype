Subject: language and gender

project : the de / construction of gender roles through language variation and change : international perspectives marlis hellinger and hadumod bussmann ( eds . ) dear linguists , actually , we had already closed the list of languages / authors ( with some 30 languages now on the project ) , but recently three languages " dropped out " , and we are looking for someone who could contribute on chinese , romanian , or yiddish . maybe hungarian could still be added . the original call for contributions ran as follows : since the establishment of feminist linguistics more than two decades ago a wealth of theoretical and empirical information has become available and we believe it is time for a collection that looks across individual language boundaries . we are therefore compiling a volume on the structural and functional aspects of gender-related variation and change in different languages . we are primarily concerned with structural properties of a language ( categories of gender , word-formation , pronominalization ) and speakers ' linguistic choices in talking about or as women and men . we are also interested in learning about the tendencies of variation and change ( including , where applicable , language politics ) as these reflect changes in the relationship between the sexes . would anyone be interested in participating ? or could someone suggest potential authors to us ? details on the project would then be made available . reply to : hellinger @ em . uni-frankfurt . de
