14th october 1998 student fee : 1500 dollars student fee include accommodations ( arranged by the school ) , meals , one day of excursion , and a copy of the proceedings of the school . transportation is not included . a few scholarships are available for students who are otherwise unable to participate at the school , and who cannot apply for the grants offered by esca . the scholarship will partially cover lodging and living expenses . day time : 3 hour in the morning , three hour in the afternoon . day free : one day with an excursion of the places around . aims : the aim of this school is to present the experiments , the theories and the perspectives of acoustic phonetics , as well as to discuss recent results in the speech literature . the school aims to provide a background for further study in many of the fields related to speech science and linguistics , including automatic speech recognition . the school will bring together leading researchers and selected students in the field of speech science and technology to discuss and disseminate the latest techniques . the school is devoted to an international audience and in particular to all students and scientists who are working on some aspects of speech and want to learn other aspects of this discipline . major topics the school will cover a number of broad themes relevant to speech , among them : 1 ) speech production and acoustic phonetics 2 ) articulatory , acoustic , and prosodic features 3 ) acoustic cues in speech perception 4 ) models of speech perception 5 ) speech processing ( preprocessing algorithms for speech ) 6 ) neural networks for automatic speech recognition 7 ) multi - modal speech recognition and recognition in adverse environments . 8 ) speech to speech translation ( vermobil and cstar projects ) 9 ) applications ( foreign language training aids , aids for handicapped , . . . . ) . 10 ) stochastic models and dialogue systems format the meeting will follow the usual format of tutorials and panel discussions together with poster sessions for contributed papers . the following tutorials are planned : abeer alwan ucla university ( ca ) usa " models of speech production and their application in coding and recognition " andrea calabrese university of connecticut ( usa ) " prosodic and phonological aspects of language " gerard chollet cnrs -
