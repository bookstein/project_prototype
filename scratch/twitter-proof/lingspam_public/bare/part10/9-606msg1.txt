symposium announcement meaning , metaphor & religion : cognitive semantics and the bible the importance of a cognitive theory of meaning for the study of religious language university of leuven , 6 - 8 july 1998 aim of the meeting this symposium aims at determining how a cognitively inspired theory of meaning ( taken in the broad sense ) provides the study of religious language with new valuable insights . specifically , it will be investigated to what extent established and ongoing research into the semantics of bible texts is supported and / or questioned by the cognitive semantic paradigm . although this meeting is primarily conceived from a linguistic point of view , it is not meant for linguists alone . instead , it explicitly aims to bring together semantic expertise from both linguistics and theology in order to explore some of the possibilities and limitations of a combined study of religious language . where ? the symposium takes place in leuven ( b ) at the historical begijnhof site ( chievre house & faculty club ) program - ralph bisschops ( brussel / duisburg ) : " metaphors disclosing new religious experiences : lover , bride and adulteress in hosea and ezekiel " - lieven boeve ( leuven ) : " linguistica ancilla theologiae : the interest of fundamental theology in cognitive linguistics " - kristin de troyer ( breda / leuven ) : " ' and god was created . . .
