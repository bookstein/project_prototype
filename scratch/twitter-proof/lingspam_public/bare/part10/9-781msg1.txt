856-4186 to communicate your problem . driving : if you arrive by car from the north or east , exit i-465 ( the circle road around indianapolis ) onto highway 67 at the sw corner of the city , and head south about 45 miles ; turn south ( left ) only highway 231 about 10 miles north of spenser , and at the first stoplight in spenser ( one of only three ! ) turn left ( east ) onto highway 46 . go two miles , then turn left into the park at a well-marked entrance . at the gate , state that your are arriving for the slavic workshop , and they will admit you without the $ 2 admission charge ) . the canyon inn is about 1 km into the park along the main road , and it is well marked . if you arrive from the south , take i-65 to highway 46 at columbus , indiana . exit west ( left ) and travel 50-60 miles through bloomington to the park , which will be on the right just before spenser . > from the west , take i-70 towards indianapolis , and exit onto highway 231 . travel about 30 miles south to spenser , then follow the directions above . > from bloomington , spenser is 15 miles to the west along highway 46 ( drive west on 17th st , which becomes 46 as it leaves bloomington ) . email me if you require additional transportation information ! accommodations the workshop will be held at the canyon inn on the territory of mccormick 's creek state park . two types of rooms are available : 1 double bed ( $ 60 / night ) 2 single beds ( $ 60 / night as single , $ 30 / person / night as double ) the rooms are small but quite nice , all with air conditioning , private bath , color tv , and the usual furnishings . we have contracted to pay the inn directly for our block of rooms ( thus saving all taxes , since we are a tax-exempt organization ! ) , and therefore you should make reservations with us via email , fax , etc . , and plan to pay us for your room upon arrival at the workshop . we prefer checks , if possible , but will take cash happily and can take credit cards if there is no other alternative ( we will have to handle this through slavica , as if you were purchasing books instead of paying for the room ) . the canyon inn has a swimming pool , and various outdoor recreation facilities are available ( hiking through the woods , horseback riding for a fee , etc . ) , so pack accordingly if you plan to take advantage of these opportunities during the workshop ! expect hot and humid weather , with daily temperatures reaching or exceeding 30 degrees celsius . overflow rooms are available at the patriot inn , about 1 km from the park entrance . these rooms cost about $ 44 single plus $ 4 - 5 per additional person in room . they are not as nice as the canyon inn rooms , and staying away from the workshop diminishes the coziness of the workshop experience , so we will not use them unless we run out of space at the canyon inn ( and this does not appear to be a problem at the moment ) . if you have to stay there , we will provide transportation to and from the conference site . if you want to stay in bloomington for a few days before or after the workshop , we have blocked some rooms in eigenmann hall , a graduate dormitory with single rooms , on-premises cafeteria , and within walking distance of our library . rooms cost about $ 28 / day ( food is not included ) , and may be paid for by credit card , cash , or checks . you should request these rooms through me in advance of the workshop , specifying arrival and departure dates . food the conference will provide the following meals at no charge to participants ( if you are accompanied by a spouse or children , they are welcome to join us but you must pay for their food ; email me for details ) . it is very important that i have an exact count before the conference , as i must provide this information to the canyon inn , so please keep me informed of your plans friday evening : outdoor picnic dinner ( barbecue chicken and ribs , various other dishes ; vegetarians can feast on salads etc . ; indoors if it rains ) saturday morning : coffee / juice / pastries / fruit at the conference room saturday lunch : buffet with sandwiches , salads , beverages , etc . sunday morning : same as saturday morning . saturday evening and sunday lunch are not provided for . i figure many people might want to go to a restaurant in bloomington , but there is a decent restaurant in the canyon inn as well , and one pleasant-looking hilltop restaurant in spenser as well . * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * george fowler [ email ] gfowler @ indiana . edu dept . of slavic languages [ dept . tel . ] 1-812 -
