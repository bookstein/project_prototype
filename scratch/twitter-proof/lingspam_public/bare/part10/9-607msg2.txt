objectives this conference is the second of a series of european conferences on research and technology for digital libraries funded by the european commission 's tmr programme . its objectives are : to bring together researchers from multiple disciplines whose science relates to the development of digital libraries ; to provide an opportunity for these scientists to form a research community in europe specific to digital library development and to enable them to discuss issues and strategies specific to the european context ; to assist young researchers in establishing relationships with senior scientists in their areas of interest ; to enable review and discussion of research under way in europe , the us , japan and other countries on digital libraries ; to stimulate researchers , especially young scientists , to explore new areas of interest in digital library development ; to establish a forum for discussion of issues specific to europe such as interoperability , multilinguality , intellectual property policy , and information commerce ; to provide an opportunity for researchers in the relevant enabling technologies and information sciences , to discuss issues related to interoperability between world wide distributed digital libraries . > from a technical point of view , the european conferences series aims to contribute to the definition of those digital library parameters which especially influence issues of access , retrieval , and interaction with information ; to identify key problems which must be solved to make digital library services an effective reality ; to identify a general structure or framework for integrating research and solutions ; and to propose and encourage specific , high priority research directions within such a framework . _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ -
