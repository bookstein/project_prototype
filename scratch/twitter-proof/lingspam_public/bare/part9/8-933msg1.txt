Subject: re : 8 . 836 , galore ?

i just read , belatedly , alan harris 's communication re punctuation . what struck me was not the inappropriate " ' " , but the word ' galore ' . what the heck is that ? is it an obligatorily post-posed adjective ? is it unique in english ? it can't be a matter of idiomatic phrases , since it seems to me it can be added to noun plural or mass noun : come out to our ranch , we ' ve got horses galore , cattle galore , sheep galore , etc . jules levin
