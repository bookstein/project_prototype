" using the methods in your auto program i obtained a 1997 bmw convertible with no money down , thanks for showing me how to obtain a great car even though i had bad credit . " m . h . columbus , ohio note : ( testimonial section has full unsolicited letters from customers that have used the auto program . ) whether you have bad credit and can not get financed , or if you have excellent credit and want to eliminate the downpayment or security deposit without increasing the monthly payment , the auto program will work for you . requirements : you must be currently employed or have a source of income and be able to make monthly payments on time . that 's it ! no car salesman to deal with ! you do not have to deal with the normal stress related to dealing with a car salesman . this also means you do not have to deal with getting rejected because of bad credit or having to take a car that is older and not the car you really want . _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ easy to use just follow the simple , step by step , directions in the auto program and obtain the late model vehicle you want . that is how easy the auto program is to use . it explains everything you need to know to obtain the late model vehicle of your choice with no downpayment or security deposit required . just pay normal monthly car payments . _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ savings to you : the auto program will save you between $ 500 to $ 5000 dollars since you will not be required to put a down payment or security deposit on the vehicle you obtain . _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ no risk , 100 % money-back guarantee the 100 % money-back guarantee is in writing in the auto program . you can return the auto program anytime within 30 days for a full refund if you are not able to obtain a late model vehicle with no downpayment or security deposit . this guarantee is regardless of your credit history as long as you use the simple methods in the auto program . _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ frequently asked questions q : how long does it take to obtain a vehicle once i receive the auto program ?
