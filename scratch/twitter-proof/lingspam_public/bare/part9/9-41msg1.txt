[ enfield @ coombs . anu . edu . au - - or n . enfield @ linguistics . unimelb . edu . au ] the aim of this workshop is to explore , with an emphasis on empirical research , the hypothesis that the grammatical structuring of meaning in a language may be influenced by cultural preoccupations of its speakers . study of the language-culture relationship has its background in anthropological linguistics and later in cognitive anthropology ( see review in d ' andrade 1995 ) . many studies have tended to focus on lexicon , with the dominant modern approach to syntax showing little interest in conceptual , and particularly cultural , issues . however , the exploration of a language-culture relationship has enjoyed a recent resurgence of interest ( gumperz & levinson 1996 , lucy 1992 , inter alia ) . while work on linguistic relativity has been concerned with the relationship between language and * thought * ( with " culture " at the periphery ) , ethnosyntax focusses more on the relationship between language and * culture * . individual contributors may show some variation as to how they see " culture " best defined and described . this workshop will be suitable for anyone interested in general linguistics , semantics , anthropological linguistics , cultural and / or cognitive anthropology . expressions of interest by propective ali participants are welcome . please contact the convenor . 3 . machine translation ( july 11 ) convenor : francis bond , ntt japan .
