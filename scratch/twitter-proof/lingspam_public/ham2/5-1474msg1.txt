theoretic approaches will be favoured over those approaches based on analogy with human cognitive processes , though mathematical discussions of such processes will be appropriate . the basic questions to be addressed include o classification of objects in a taxonomy : systemic classification , semantic indexing , partial-order sorting , description identification , and taxonomy maintenance . o efficient order , lattice , graph , and code theoretic operations on objects : subsumption , generalization , specialization , least common generalization , and greatest common specialization . o advanced uses of taxonomies : knowledge compression , knowledge compilation , and knowledge evolution . o using classified knowledge : classification as problem solving , classification as constraint satisfaction , and exploiting abstraction . o scalable techniques for large object databases o integration of data and knowledge base technologies the symposium will maintain a balance between theoretical issues and descriptions of implemented systems providing a balance between theory and practice . the focus of the symposium is on efficiency of retrieval , use and storage . authors ' information papers may not exceed 15 pages . shorter , substantive papers are welcome . authors are requested to submit five ( 5 ) copies of their paper . alternatively , electronic submissions ( by ftp or email ) of papers ( postscript output ) are encouraged . submission by ftp : please place in ftp . cs . rmit . edu . au incoming directory . authors are further requested to attach title pages to their submissions bearing their names , addresses , telephone numbers , fax numbers and e-mail addresses . in addition , authors are asked to include abstracts of approximately twenty ( 20 ) lines with each paper , and a list of short phrases descriptive of the content . papers must be postmarked on or before monday february 13 , 1995 . address : kruse c / o gerard ellis computer science dept . rmit gpo box 2476v , melbourne , vic 3001 australia email : ged @ cs . rmit . edu . au ph : 61 -
