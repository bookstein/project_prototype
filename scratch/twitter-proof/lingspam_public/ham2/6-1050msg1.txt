Subject: q : help with french translation

i need help with the translation of the french word " barine " . from the context ( a song by augusta holme ` s , including the lines " je suis ivan , fils du barine " ) i infer that it 's some member of russian nobility , but have been unable to find it in 4 dictionaries . please e-mail responses directly to me , as this can't really be of wide interest . thanks . susan fischer
