Subject: judgment fatigue , summary part ii : stromswold , ross , tang boyland , be

asley the following are what i found to be especially informative quotes from four individual respondents who gave specific comments regarding the types of stimuli which tend to induce judgment fatigue . kimberly barskaitiki also sent a long , specific , detailed response with many interesting examples . ( thank you ! ) her response is not included here because it presented fewer strong , testable , theoretical claims . ( i must note here that ross and beasley are quoted without their expressed permission , for which i hereby beseech the authors ' belated dispensations . i post all comments here in only the most charitable light , with the hope of sharing the author 's experience and information . ) * * * * * * * * * * * * * * > as a graduate student at mit in 1986 , i wrote a paper on the > phenomenon you described for a course i took with merrill garrett . i > dubbed the phenomenon " syntactic satiation " as a nod to work on > semantic satiation ( the widely studied phenomenon that words loose > their ' meaning ' on repeated presentation . e . g . . , repeat the word > " snow " 20 times and it starts sounding funny . and you can't come up > with as many semantically associated words like " ice " and " cold " ) . > > the study was n't rigorously done and i never attempted to publish the > paper ( which was called " syntactic satiation ) , but what i discovered > was > > 1 ) with repeated judgments , subjects ' judgments got less certain and > reliable ( some subjects explicitly said they were n't sure anymore ) . > but even before subjects ' lost confidence in their judgments / made > mistakes , they got much slower in making judgments . > > 2 ) syntactic satiation seems to be relatively specific . for example , > i had my subjects make repeated judgments of wh-questions ( e . g . , > that-t , long distance , island etc . ) and i found that their ability to > judge wh-questiosn was impaired , but not their ability to judge other > stimuli ( e . g . , double object datives ) > > 3 ) satiation did * not * occur when subjects were asked to make > judgments about semantic plausibility ( where implausible > sentences involved violations of animacy restrictions , e . g . , > the juice spilled the child that stained the rug ) > > 4 ) i also did n't get any clear evidence of satiation at the > morphological level ( e . g . , asking subjects to judge sentences > with case / tense violations , e . g . , i gave it to he ; she give him a book ) > > 5 ) rate of presentation seemed to be an important factor in inducing > satiation . if subjects are urged to go quickly , they satiate faster . > this goes along with findings in the semantic satiation where whether > semantic priming or satiation occurs seems to depend on rate of > presentation ( at least in part ) . > > 6 ) being forced to make ungraded judgments ( i . e . , good vs . bad with no > intermediate judgments allowed ) also seemed to induce faster satiation > > 7 ) satiation seems to be temporary , although i can't say what the > refractory period is . it is probably less than 1 month ( the interval > i retested at ) > > 8 ) i did n't detect satiation when i gave subjects mixtures of sentences > to judge ( in my case , datives , passives , wh-questions , and tense / case ) . > > when i did the lit review for the paper , i found a few other studies > that looked at things related to syntactic satiation / syntactic priming . > i will see if i can dig up the paper and find the references for you . > also , william snyder at mit presented a poster ( ?
