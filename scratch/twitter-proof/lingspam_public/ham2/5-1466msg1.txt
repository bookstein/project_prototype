syntax wesley hudson . pragmatic constraints on binding into noun phrases . ph . d . diss . u . s . c . distr . by gsil publications ( gsil @ usc . edu ) this study analyzes a set of constructions referred to as specificity effects , where the possibility of extracting from within or binding into a noun phrase depends on non-syntactic properties of the np . in contrast to a number of syntactic studies of this phenomenon ( fiengo and higginbotham ( 1981 ) , bower ( 1987 ) , diesing ( 1990 ) ) , this work argues for a non-syntactic analysis of specificity effects . thus the inability to quantify into specific nps follows from a pragmatic equivalent to structurally determined wide scope readings . the class of nps which induce such wide scope readings is defined in terms of two distinct pragmatic properties . the first is referentiality as defined in burge ( 1974 ) , where the interpretations of referential nps are relativized to acts of reference performed on particular occasion of utterance . the second property is based on hawkins ( 1991 ) 's approach to anaphora with ( in ) definite nps ' and involves the implicatures speakers utilize in conveying whether or not a referent is identifiable . these pragmatic properties are shown to correlate with the opacity of nps more closely than syntactic or semantic properties . gsil pulbications patricia schneider - zioga . the syntax of clitic doubling in modern greek . 1994 in this dissertation it is argued that clitic doubling involves a predication structure where a clitic left dislocated ( cllded ) expression , which is a copy of the clitic doubled expression , is the subject of the predication and the clitic and doubled expression serve as the predicate variable ( cf . iatridou ( 1991 ) for clld ) : ( a ) noun phrasej [ predicate . . . cliticj - v noun phrasej . . . ] either the cllded or the doubled argument may phonetically delete . the difference between clitic doubling and clld is a matter of whether the topic or the doubled expression is phonetically ( but not syntactically ) deleted . this proposal accounts for what kind of lexical projections allow clitic - doubling ; the difference in behavior between accusative and oblique clitic doubled expressions ; the impossibility of doubling qps that contain expressions needing antecedents and other reconstruction effects ; as well as the scope interpretation of doubled qps . assymetries between clitic doubling and clld are also addressed . for more information , please contact : gsil @ usc . edu liliane haegeman , the syntax of sentential negation . 1993 / 94 ca . 250pp . paperbound approx . usd 50 rosenberg & sellier via andrea doria 14 , i-10123 torino ( credit card accepted ) this collection comprises papers by : l . haegeman , n . duffield , i . laka , j . ouhalla , e . pearce , l . progovac , g . puskas , m - l . rivero and r . zanuttini . it appears in two successive issues of " rivista di linguistica " : 5 , 2 ( 1993 ) and 6 , 1 ( 1994 ) ; the second one will be available very soon . an obvious alternative to the separate purchase of these issues is the subscription to the journal . | | | | - - - - pier marco bertinetto scuola normale superiore / / / / / / / - - - - - - - / / / / / / / - - - - - - - tel . + + 39 / ( 0 ) 50 / 509111 p . za dei cavalieri 7 / / / / / / / - - - - - - - fax : + + 39 / ( 0 ) 50 / 563513 i-56126 pisa / / / / / / / - - - - - - - / / / / / / / - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - history of ling murray , stephen o .
