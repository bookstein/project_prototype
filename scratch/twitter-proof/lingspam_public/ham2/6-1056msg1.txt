Subject: what non-linguists notice about speech

i am looking for information on the investigation of what non-linguists notice about spoken language . which aspects of spoken language ( phonological , syntactical , lexical , and so on ) catch people 's attention , and how do non - linguists understand and categorize their awareness of others ' speech ? if anyone knows of research in this area , i would be grateful to hear about it . s . krainz ( v367my88 @ ubvms . cc . buffalo . edu )
